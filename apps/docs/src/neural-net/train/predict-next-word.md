=======================================================================================
### Predict Next Word Based On Vectors of Learned Context Patterns in Training Examples
=======================================================================================

Comprehensive training function for a self-attention transformer using custom torch.js.
This function implements a decoder-only transformer architecture similar to GPT models,
training it with synthetic data using the Adam optimizer and GPU.js for acceleration.
In real applications, this would be:
- Tokenized text data (e.g., using BPE, WordPiece, or SentencePiece)
- Loaded from datasets like WikiText, BookCorpus, or Common Crawl
- Preprocessed with appropriate padding and attention masks

Key architectural components:
- Token and positional embeddings
- Multi-head self-attention blocks
- Layer normalization
- Linear output projection
- Cross-entropy loss computation
- Adam optimization with backpropagation

Advanced usage scenarios:
- Fine-tuning on domain-specific data
- Transfer learning from pre-trained weights
- Ensemble methods with multiple trained models
- Model compression and quantization

### Returns

`Promise`&lt;`Object`&gt;

Training results containing final loss and model

### Example

```javascript
import { trainNextWordPrediction, Transformer } from './transformer-training.js';

// Train a new model
const results = await trainNextWordPrediction();
console.log('Training completed with final loss:', results.finalLoss);

// Generate a language response based using the trained model
const model = results.model;
const predictions = model.forward(inputTokens);
```
