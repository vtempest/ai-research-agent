          ### 🚜📜 Tractor the Text Extractor 

          1. Main Content Detection: Extract the main content from a URL by
          combining 

          Mozilla Readability and Postlight Mercury algorithms, utilizing over
          100 

          custom adapters for major sites for article, author, date HTML
          classes.

          2. Basic HTML Standardization: Transform complex HTML into a
          simplified 

          reading-mode format of basic HTML, making it ideal for research note
          archival
            and focused reading, with headings, images and links.
          3. YouTube Transcript Processing: When a YouTube video URL is
          detected, 

          retrieve the complete video transcript including both manual captions
          and 

          auto-generated subtitles, maintaining proper timestamp synchronization
          and 

          speaker identification where available.

          4. PDF to HTML: Process PDF documents by extracting
            formatted text while intelligently handling line breaks, page headers, 
            footnotes. The system analyzes text height statistics to automatically
            infer heading levels, creating a properly structured document hierarchy
            based on standard deviation from mean text size.
          5. Citation Information Extraction: Identify and extract citation
          metadata
            including author names, publication dates, sources, and titles using HTML
            meta tags and common class name patterns. The system validates author names
            against a comprehensive database of 90,000 first and last names, 
          distinguishing between personal and organizational authors to
          properly 

          format citations.

          6. Author Name Formatting: Process author names by checking against 

          known name databases, handling affixes and titles correctly, and
          determining
            whether to reverse the name order based on whether it's a personal or 
          organizational author, ensuring proper citation formatting.
