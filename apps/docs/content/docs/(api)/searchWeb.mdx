          Search the web by sending a query via SearXNG metasearch engine of
          100+ sources.

          You can specify the type of content you want—such as general web
          results,

          news articles, videos, images, science topics, files, or IT-related 

          information—by choosing the appropriate category. 

          Additional filters let you narrow results by recency (like results

          from the past day, week, month, or year), language, and page number.

          The API returns a structured list of results, each including a title,
          URL, snippet, domain, and other useful details, making it easy to
          display or analyze the information. This flexible and robust search
          tool is ideal for apps, research projects, and any situation where
          up-to-date, diverse web data is needed.
