## 🧠💻 Reimagine the Internet as Self-Organizing Mind Map

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Z9OJMwd.gif" />
</p>

📜 [Research Paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EuV4fTKsBiBIyDDuc4ss47oFFUVjCsXX/view)

Critical times call for critical thinkers to create a crowdsourced argument reasoning dataset, for AI models to recommend research quotes, to evolve crowdsourced chain-of-thought reasoning, to unlock faster ways to read long articles, to monitor developments by topic modeling a knowledge base graph, and to provide a public service of answers to research.

Language Models can distill the essence of collective thought into a vector space where every point has a weighted value representing its contribution to the overall decision-making process, leading to direct democratic AI economy where public votes reward influence. AI will show its reasoning based on what sentences and cites it used from the collective research, so that people can see it is aligned with our interests. Research Agents recommend articles for human researchers working alongside AI to develop a summarized topic outline as a public service. The agents monitor for any related articles via web searches for keywords associated with that Topic Model. Imagine uploading a research paper, then the app extracts full text of reference cites and creates topic model and keyword summaries, then monitors that literature base and stores highlights. People will make personal knowledge bases of what influences them to create AI assistants cloning their mind-uploaded perspective and interests in a self-organizing mind map. Similar apps are Anthropic Claude, Obsidian, SciSpace and Perplexity, showing that people need an emergence of this "self-organizing mind map" approach to manage the complexity of information flow.

### 🚜📜 Tractor the Text Extractor

<p align="center">
  <img width="350px" src="https://i.imgur.com/o8NTXxY.png" />
</p>

[extract Docs](https://airesearch.js.org/functions/extractor/url-to-content/)

1. Main Content Detection: Extract the main content from a URL by combining Mozilla Readability and Postlight Mercury algorithms, utilizing over 100 custom adapters for major sites for article, author, date HTML classes.
2. YouTube Transcript Processing: When a YouTube video URL is detected, retrieve the complete video transcript including both manual captions and auto-generated subtitles, maintaining proper timestamp synchronization.
3. PDF to HTML: Extracts formatted text from PDF with parsing of linebreaks , page headers, footnotes, and section headings. Supports fonts, links, bold, italics, lists, headings, headers, footnotes, and Table of Contents, Quotes, and Code Blocks. Removes repeated headers, links footnote anchors to the footnote, and preserves number of the PDF page with invisible I element. This function uses [pdfjs-serverless](https://github.com/johannschopplich/pdfjs-serverless) to work in more environments than PDF.js-based tools: Cloudflare workers, serverless, node.js, and front-end only.
4. Basic HTML Standardization: Transform complex HTML into a simplified reading-mode format of basic HTML, making it ideal for research note archival and focused reading, with headings, images and links.
5. Cite: Identify and extract citation metadata including author names, publication dates, sources, and titles using HTML meta tags and common class name patterns. The system validates author names against a comprehensive database of 90,000 first and last names, distinguishing between personal and organizational authors to properly format citations.

### 🔤📊 SEEKTOPIC: Summarization by Extracting Entities, Keyword Tokens, and Outline Phrases Important to Context

<p align="center">
  <img width="350px" src="https://i.imgur.com/nMoDgz6.jpeg" />
</p>

[extractSEEKTOPIC Docs](https://airesearch.js.org/functions/topics/seektopic-keyphrases)\
[SEEKTOPIC Sample Output](https://github.com/vtempest/ai-research-agent/blob/master/test/data/)

SEEKTOPIC can be used to find unique, domain-specific keyphrases using noun Ngrams. The user can click on keyphrases or LLM can suggest questions based on them. The user can see highlighted just the most important sentences that centralize and tie in the core topics. It is possible to vectorize and compare the dot product similarity of query to keyphrases which are then mapped to parts of the document like section labels. This is more in line with how humans think of article organization into section headings and lead sentences which tie in concepts from others.

SEEKTOPIC extracts unique, domain-specific key phrases from a document using noun n-grams and ranks sentences based on their centrality to the most frequently referenced key phrase concepts, enabling efficient extraction of domain-specific content and provides a flexible framework for summarization.

1. Sentence Segmentation: Split the text into sentences, accounting for  common abbreviations, numbers, URLs, and other exceptions.
2. Tokenization and Phrase Extraction: Employ a Wiki Phrases tokenizer to identify wiki topics, phrases, and nouns. This includes spell-checking and checks the root words using Porter Stemmer (e.g., "video gaming" is tokenized as "video game").
3. Noun N-gram Extraction: Generate noun edge-grams, allowing for stop words in the middle (e.g., "state of the art").
4. Key Phrase Consolidation: Merge smaller n-grams that are subsets of larger ones by comparing weights.
5. Domain Specificity Calculation: Determine named entities and phrase domain specificity using WikiIDF. This rewards unique key phrases specific to the document's field (e.g., "endocrinology" in medical texts or "thou shall" in religious texts).
6. Key Phrase Filtering: Select top key phrases based on a combination of frequency and word count.
7. Graph Construction: Create a double-ring weighted graph with key phrases in the central ring and sentences in the outer ring. Assign weights to links based on concept usage probability.
8. Sentence Weighting: Apply TextRank algorithm to weight sentences, identifying those that centralize and connect key phrase concepts most referenced by other sentences. This process, based on TextRank and PageRank, includes random surfing and jumping to avoid getting stuck in loops (like page headers).
9. Top Results Selection: Select top sentences and key phrases based on overall weight and graph centrality, using either a fixed number or percentage for larger documents.
10. Output Generation: Return top sentences (with associated key phrases) and top key phrases (with associated sentences).
11. Dynamic Reranking: If a user interacts with a key phrase or if there's a search query leading to the document, compare query similarity to key phrases, heavily weight the most similar key phrase, and reapply TextRank from step 8.

### 🕸️🖥️ Tardigrade the Web Crawler

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/iuzpcvD.png" width="350px" />
</p>

[scrapeURL Docs](https://airesearch.js.org/functions/extractor/url-to-content/scrape-url)

1. First Use Fetch API, check for bot detection. Scrape any domain's URL to get its HTML, JSON, or Binary Buffer.\
   Scraping internet pages is a [free speech right](https://blog.apify.com/is-web-scraping-legal/)  to access information.
2. Features: timeout, redirects, default UA, referer as google, and bot\
   detection checking.
3. If fetch method does not get needed HTML, use Docker container wih proxy as backup.
4. [Setup Docker](https://github.com/vtempest/ai-research-agent/tree/master/packages/crawler)\
   container with NodeJS server API renders with puppeteer DOM to get all HTML loaded by\
   secondary in-page API requests after the initial page request, including user login and cookie storage.
5. Bypass Cloudflare bot check: A webpage proxy that request through Chromium (puppeteer) - can be used\
   to bypass Cloudflare anti bot using cookie id javascript method.
6. Send your request to the server with the port 3000 and add your URL to the "url"\
   query string like this: `http://localhost:3000/?url=https://example.org`. Pass in this proxy url in the fetch request.

### 🌍📖 WORLD: Wikipedia Outline Relational Lexicon & Dictionary

<p align="center">
  <img width="350px" src="https://i.imgur.com/ffaU3s7.jpeg" />
</p>

[compileTopicModel Docs](https://airesearch.js.org/functions/datasets/compile-topic-model)

Search and outline a research base using Wikipedia's 100k popular pages as the core topic phrases graph for LLM Research Agents. Most of the documents online (and by extension thinking in the collective conciousness) can revolve around core topic phrases linked as a graph. If all the available docs are nodes, the links in the graph can be extracted Wiki page entities and mappings of dictionary phrases to their wiki page. These can serve as topic labels, keywords, and suggestions for LLM followup questions. Documents can be linked in a graph with: 1. wiki page entity recognition 2. frequent keyphrases 3. html links 4. research paper references 5. keyphrases to query in global web search 6. site-specific recommendations. These can lay the foundation for LLM Research Agents to fully grok, summarize, and outline a research base.

* 240K total words & phrases, first 117K first-word or single words to check every token against. 100K Wikipedia Page Titles and links - Wikipedia most popular pages titles. Also includes domain specificity score and what letters should be capital.
* 84K words and 67K phrases in dictionary lexicon OpenEnglishWordNet, a better updated version of Wordnet - multiple definitions per term, 120k definitions, 45 concept categories
* JSON Prefix Trie - arranged by sorting words and phrases for lookup by first word to tokenize by word, then find if it starts a phrase based on entries, for Phrase Extraction from a text. There is ["consensus"](https://johnresig.com/blog/javascript-trie-performance-analysis/) that Prefix Trie [O(1) lookups](https://github.com/daviddwlee84/LeetCode/blob/master/Notes/DataStructure/Trie_PrefixTree.md) (instead of thaving to loop through the index for each lookup) makes it the best data type for this task.

### 📈📝 WRITEFAT: Weigh Relevance by Inference of Topics, Entities, and Frequency Averages for Terms

<p align="center">
  <img width="350px" src="https://i.imgur.com/e2uTpoh.png" />
</p>

[weighRelevanceTermFrequency Docs](https://airesearch.js.org/functions/match/weigh-relevance-frequency)

![WRITEFAT Formula](https://i.imgur.com/gCjSQeV.png)

Calculate term specificity for a single doc with BM25 formula by using Wikipedia term frequencies as the baseline Inverse Frequency across Documents. WikiBM25 solves the need to pass in all docs to compute against all documents in a database. The problem with BM25 and TF-IDF is that a large set of documents is needed to find the words that are repeated often across all. These overused words are often the same list of words, so using Wikipedia's term frequencies ensures a common sense baseline against a neutral corpus.

**Data Model**: All words in English Wikipedia are sorted by number of pages they are in for 325K words with frequencies of at least 32 wikipages, between 3 to 23 characters of Latin alphanumerics like az09, punctuation like .-, and diacritics like éï, but filtering out numbers and foreign language.\
Use this list to Replace or Combine with All Documents IDF - Many websites may have less than a hundred pages to search through and that is not enough to find which terms are domain-specific. They can score a single doc at a time to find the weight each word in query gets. Wikipedia IDf can be a baseline IDF to average with the All Docs IDF for uniqueness across the average public and the specific domain.

**Example**: Given a query "Superbowl wins by year" we do not want to simply return docs filled with common words like year, but rather recognize Superbowl is more domain-specific. This requires precomputing IDF values across all docs, and for websites that may not have that many docs to start with may consider averaging their precomputed score with wikiIDF values to ensure most unique words get a score.

**LLM RAG Use Case**: LLM RAG Chunk to Query Similarity - When we chunk a document into parts to find which to pass into a LLM prompt, they need to be weighed by relevance to the query. Semantic Embedding with a LLM not only takes resources to compute & store the vectors, it also [performs worse (video)](https://youtu.be/9QJXvNiJIG8?si=ey4GbqtV8tD5WV2P\&t=725) than BM25 on its own. Hybrid BM25 & Embeddings RAG is best, but there may not be time to compute BM25 idf scores across all doc chunks. We need a fast way to distinguish more unique words to give them more weight rather than common short words that get repeated a lot in an edge case paragraph. WikiBM25 is the best in use cases like realtime web search where chunking the text cannot be done beforehand.

### 🧩🔍 Autocomplete & Query To Topic Phrase Tokenization

<p align="center">
  <img width="350px" src="https://i.imgur.com/tMjFGe4.jpeg" />
</p>

[suggestNextWordCompletions Docs](https://airesearch.js.org/functions/tokenize/suggest-complete-word)

Search-on-keystroke and load this JSON index for word and phrase completion, sorted by how common the terms are with IDF, for search autocomplete dropdown. Tokening by word can often have a meaning widely different than if it is part of a phrase, so it is better to extract phrases by first-word next-words pairings. Search results will be more accurate if we infer likely phrases and search for those words occuring together and not just split into words and find frequency. Examples are "white house" or "state of the art" which should be searched as a phrase but would return different context if split into words. As Led Zeppelin famously put it: ♫ "'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings."

  * ❓ **Inputs**: 👄 Language Intelligence Provider, 🔑 API Key,  🤖
    agent template name, 🧠 model name and options,
    and 🆎 context variables for that agent
  * 🤖 **Agent Instruction Templates**:
    [LangHub](https://smith.langchain.com/hub) template or custom:
    question(query, chat\_history), summarize-bullets(article), summarize(article),
    suggest-followups(chat\_history, article), answer-cite-sources(context, chat\_history, query),
    query-resolution(chat\_history, query), knowledge-graph-nodes(query, article),
    summary-longtext(summaries)
  * 🧠 **How Language Models Work**: Language models learn from billions
    of text examples to

  identify statistical patterns and structures across diverse sources,
  converting words into
  high-dimensional vectors—numerical lists that capture meaning and relationships between concepts.
  These mathematical representations allow models to understand that "king/queen" share properties
  and "Paris/France" mirrors "Tokyo/Japan" through their transformer architecture, a neural network
  backbone that processes information through multiple layers of analysis. The attention mechanism
  enables the system to dynamically focus on relevant parts of input text when generating each word,
  maintaining context like humans tracking conversation threads, while calculating probability scores
  across the entire vocabulary for each word position based on processed context. Rather than retrieving
  stored responses, models create novel text by selecting the most probable words given learned
  patterns, maintaining coherence across long passages while adapting to specific prompt nuances
  through deep pattern recognition.\
  **Self-Attention**: Each word creates three representations: Query (what it's looking for), Key (what
  it offers), and Value (its actual content). For example, in "The cat sat on the mat," the word "cat"
  has a Query vector that searches for actions, a Key vector that advertises itself as a subject, and
  a Value vector containing its semantic meaning as an animal. The attention mechanism calculates how
  much "cat" should focus on other words by comparing its Query with their Keys - finding high
  similarity with "sat" (the action) - then combines the corresponding Value vectors to create a
  contextualized representation where "cat" now understands it's the one doing the sitting.

### generateLanguageResponse()

```ts
function generateLanguageResponse(options: object): Promise<{
  content: string;
  error: string;
  extract: any;
}>;
```

Defined in: [src/agents/generate-language.js:105](https://github.com/vtempest/ai-research-agent/tree/master/packages/ai-research-agent/src/agents/generate-language.js#L105)

### Generate Language Response

Writes language response showing human-like understanding of the question and context.

* *Requires*: LLM provider, API Key, agent name, and context input variables for agent.
* *Providers*: groq, togetherai, openai, anthropic, xai, google, perplexity, ollama, cloudflare
* *Agent Templates*: any template from [LangHub](https://smith.langchain.com/hub) or custom:
  summarize-bullets(article), summarize(article), summary-longtext(summaries),
  suggest-followups(chat\_history, article), answer-cite-sources(context, chat\_history, query),
  query-resolution(chat\_history, query), knowledge-graph-nodes(query, article)
* *How it Works*: Language models are trained on vast amounts of text to predict
  the most likely next word or sequence of words given a prompt. They represent words and
  their contexts as high-dimensional vectors, allowing them to capture complex relationships
  and nuances in language. Using neural network architectures like transformers, these models
  analyze input text, apply attention mechanisms to understand context by multiplying scores
  of all other words, using multiple attention head starting points, and generate human-like
  responses based on learned patterns.

### Jaro-Winkler String Similarity Comparison

<img width="350px" src="https://i.imgur.com/1qpRzNh.png" />

Measures similarity between two strings, taking into account the common characters and
their positions. Jaro-Winkler is often used in record linkage and data cleansing to improve
the accuracy of string matching, particularly for names and addresses, by giving
more weight to the common prefix and penalizing longer string differences.  It is [more
optimal](https://medium.com/@appaloosastore/string-similarity-algorithms-compared-3f7b4d12f0ff)
for words than [Levenshtein distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance):

1. Edit operations: Levenshtein considers insertions, deletions, and substitutions,
   while Jaro focuses on transpositions.
2. Sensitivity to string length: Levenshtein is more sensitive to overall
   string length, while Jaro normalizes for length in its formula.
3. Prefix matching: The Jaro-Winkler variant explicitly rewards matching
   prefixes, which Levenshtein does not.
4. Scale of results: Levenshtein produces an edit distance (usually converted to a similarity score),
   while Jaro directly produces a similarity score.

### Split Text by Semantic Characters

<img width="350px" src="https://i.imgur.com/RpXf5as.png" />

Splits document text into semantic chunks based on various textual and structural
elements like HTML, markdown, and paragraphs.

This function performs a comprehensive tokenization of the input text, considering a wide range
of semantic elements and structural patterns commonly found in documents. It uses regular
expressions to identify and separate the following elements:

1. Headings (Setext-style, Markdown, and HTML-style)
2. Citations (e.g., \[1])
3. List items (bulleted, numbered, lettered, or task lists, including nested up to three levels)
4. Block quotes (including nested quotes and citations, up to three levels)
5. Code blocks (fenced, indented, or HTML pre/code tags)
6. Tables (Markdown, grid tables, and HTML tables)
7. Horizontal rules (Markdown and HTML hr tag)
8. Standalone lines or phrases (including single-line blocks and HTML elements)
9. Sentences or phrases ending with punctuation (including ellipsis and Unicode punctuation)
10. Quoted text, parenthetical phrases, or bracketed content
11. Paragraphs
12. HTML-like tags and their content (including self-closing tags and attributes)
13. LaTeX-style math expressions (inline and block)
14. Any remaining content (fallback)

The function applies various length constraints to each type of element to ensure reasonable
chunk sizes. It also handles nested structures and special cases like code blocks and math
expressions.

### Convert Text Query to Topic Phrase Tokens

<img width="350px" src="https://i.imgur.com/NDrmSRQ.png" />

Returns a list of phrases that are found in Wiki Titles/ dictionary phrases World Model
that match the input phrase, or just the single word if found. Search results will be
more accurate if we infer likely phrases and search for those words occuring together and
not just split into words and find frequency. Examples are "white house" or "state of the art"
which should be searched as a phrase but would return different context if split into words.

### 🔤📊 SEEKTOPIC: Summarization by Extracting Entities, Keyword Tokens, and Outline Phrases Important to Context

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/gZ4kI1V.png" width="360px" />

Extracts unique, domain-specific key phrases from a document using noun
n-grams and ranks sentences based on their centrality to the most frequently
referenced key phrase concepts,  enabling efficient extraction of
domain-specific content. This can be a first step to use key sentences or topics
to vectorize or fit more docs into context limit and visualize them in vector space.

1. Sentence Segmentation: Split the text into sentences, accounting for
   common abbreviations, numbers, URLs, and other exceptions.
2. Tokenization and Phrase Extraction: Employ a Wiki Phrases tokenizer to
   identify wiki topics, phrases, and nouns. This includes spell-checking
   and root word verification using Porter Stemmer.
3. Noun N-gram Extraction: Generate noun edge-grams, allowing for stop words
   in the middle (e.g., "state of the art").
4. Key Phrase Consolidation: Merge smaller n-grams that are subsets of
   larger ones by comparing weights.
5. Domain Specificity Calculation: Determine named entities and phrase
   domain specificity using WikiIDF. This rewards unique key phrases
   specific to the document's field (e.g., "endocrinology" in medical texts
   or "thou shall" in religious texts).
6. Key Phrase Filtering: Select top key phrases based on a combination of
   frequency and word count.
7. Graph Construction: Create a double-ring weighted graph with key phrases
   in the central ring and sentences in the outer ring. Assign weights to
   links based on concept usage probability.
8. Sentence Weighting: Apply TextRank algorithm to weight sentences,
   identifying those that centralize and connect key phrase concepts most
   referenced by other sentences. This process, based on TextRank and
   PageRank, includes random surfing and jumping to avoid loops.
9. Top Results Selection: Select top sentences and key phrases based on
   overall weight and graph centrality, using either a fixed number or
   percentage for larger documents.
10. Output Generation: Return top sentences (with associated key phrases)
    and top key phrases (with associated sentences).
11. Dynamic Reranking: If a user interacts with a key phrase or if there's a
    search query leading to the document, compare query similarity to key
    phrases, heavily weight the most similar key phrase, and reapply
    TextRank from step 8.

### extractTopicTermGroupsLDA()

```ts
function extractTopicTermGroupsLDA(sentences: string[], options?: object): any[];
```

Defined in: [src/topics/topic-distribution.js:31](https://github.com/vtempest/ai-research-agent/tree/master/packages/ai-research-agent/src/topics/topic-distribution.js#L31)

Latent Dirichlet (pronounced Dee-ruesh-ley) allocation  is used
in natural language processing to discover abstract topics in a
collection of documents. It is a generative probabilistic model
that assumes documents are mixtures of topics, where a topic
is a probability distribution over words. LDA uses Bayesian
inference to simultaneously learn the topics and topic mixtures
that occur around each other in an unsupervised manner. <br />

```ts
function convertHTMLToBasicHTML(html: string, options?: object): string;
```

Defined in: [src/extractor/html-to-content/html-to-basic-html.js:33](https://github.com/vtempest/ai-research-agent/tree/master/packages/ai-research-agent/src/extractor/html-to-content/html-to-basic-html.js#L33)

Strip HTML to \~30 basic markup HTML tags, lists, tables, images.

### extractContent()

```ts
function extractContent(urlOrDoc: string | Document, options?: object): object;
```

Defined in: [src/extractor/url-to-content/url-to-content.js:88](https://github.com/vtempest/ai-research-agent/tree/master/packages/ai-research-agent/src/extractor/url-to-content/url-to-content.js#L88)

### 🚜📜 Tractor the Text Extractor

<img width="350px" src="https://i.imgur.com/o8NTXxY.png" />

1. Main Content Detection: Extract the main content from a URL by combining
   Mozilla Readability and Postlight Mercury algorithms, utilizing over 100
   custom adapters for major sites for article, author, date HTML classes.
2. Basic HTML Standardization: Transform complex HTML into a simplified
   reading-mode format of basic HTML, making it ideal for research note archival
   and focused reading, with headings, images and links.
3. YouTube Transcript Processing: When a YouTube video URL is detected,
   retrieve the complete video transcript including both manual captions and
   auto-generated subtitles, maintaining proper timestamp synchronization and
   speaker identification where available.
4. PDF to HTML: Process PDF documents by extracting
   formatted text while intelligently handling line breaks, page headers,
   footnotes. The system analyzes text height statistics to automatically
   infer heading levels, creating a properly structured document hierarchy
   based on standard deviation from mean text size.
5. Citation Information Extraction: Identify and extract citation metadata
   including author names, publication dates, sources, and titles using HTML
   meta tags and common class name patterns. The system validates author names
   against a comprehensive database of 90,000 first and last names,
   distinguishing between personal and organizational authors to properly
   format citations.
6. Author Name Formatting: Process author names by checking against
   known name databases, handling affixes and titles correctly, and determining
   whether to reverse the name order based on whether it's a personal or
   organizational author, ensuring proper citation formatting.
7. Content Validation: Verify the extracted content's accuracy by comparing
   results from multiple extraction methods, ensuring all essential elements
   are preserved and properly formatted for the intended use case.

### Tardigrade the Web Crawler

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/iuzpcvD.png" width="350px" />

1. **Use Fetch API, check for bot detection.** Scrape  any domain's URL to get its HTML, JSON, or arraybuffer.<br />
   Scraping internet pages is a [free speech right
   ](https://blog.apify.com/is-web-scraping-legal/).

2. Features: timeout, redirects, default UA, referer as google, and bot
   detection checking. <br />

3. If fetch method does not get needed HTML, use Docker proxy as backup.

4. [Setup Docker](https://github.com/vtempest/ai-research-agent/tree/master/src/crawler)
   container with NodeJS server API renders with puppeteer DOM to get all HTML loaded by
   secondary in-page API requests after the initial page request, including user login and cookie storage.

5. Bypass Cloudflare bot check: A webpage proxy that request through Chromium (puppeteer) - can be used
   to bypass Cloudflare anti bot using cookie id javascript method.

6. Send your request to the server with the port 3000 and add your URL to the "url"
   query string like this: `http://localhost:3000/?url=https://example.org`

7. Optional: Setup residential IP proxy to access sites that IP-block datacenters
   and manage rotation with [Scrapoxy](https://scrapoxy.io). Recommended:
   [Hypeproxy](https://hypeproxy.io/products/static-residential-proxies)
   [NinjasProxy](https://ninjasproxy.com/residential-proxies/)

```ts

### HTML-to-Main-Content Extractor #2

1. The algorithm starts by loading the HTML content using linkedom, a lightweight DOM parser for Node.js.
2. It then applies a series of cleaning and scoring techniques to identify the main content of
   the page, starting with stripping unlikely candidates (e.g., elements with class names like "comment"
   or "sidebar").
3. The HTML is converted into a series of paragraph elements, which are then scored based on various
   factors such as text length, number of commas, and the presence of certain class names or IDs.
4. The algorithm assigns scores to parent and grandparent elements based on the scores of their
   children, with parents receiving the full score and grandparents receiving half.
5. After scoring, the algorithm finds the top candidate element by selecting the node with the
   highest score.
6. The top candidate's siblings are then examined to see if they should be included in the main
   content, based on their scores and other factors like link density.
7. The algorithm then cleans the selected content by removing unnecessary tags, attributes, and empty
   elements.
8. It also handles special cases like cleaning up header tags, images, and other potentially irrelevant
   content.
9. Throughout the process, the algorithm uses various regular expressions and scoring heuristics to
   identify positive and negative indicators of content relevance.
10. Finally, the cleaned and extracted content is returned as an HTML string, representing the main
    body of the article or webpage.

### extractMainContentFromHTML()

```ts
function extractMainContentFromHTML(html: any, options?: object): Element;
```

Defined in: [src/extractor/html-to-content/extract-content/extract-content-readability.js:60](https://github.com/vtempest/ai-research-agent/tree/master/packages/ai-research-agent/src/extractor/html-to-content/extract-content/extract-content-readability.js#L60)

### HTML-to-Main-Content Extractor #1

The function extracts main content with regex patterns, cleaning HTML, scoring nodes
based on content indicators like paragraphs and id/class names, selecting
the top candidate, extracting it, and cleaning up content around it.

1. Define regular expressions:
   * Various regex patterns are defined to identify content and non-content areas.

2. Define helper functions:
   * normalizeSpaces: Normalizes whitespace in a string.
   * stripTags: Removes all HTML tags from a string.
   * getTextLength: Calculates the length of text after stripping tags.
   * calculateLinkDensity: Calculates the ratio of link text to total text.

3. Clean HTML:
   * Remove unlikely candidates (e.g., ads, sidebars) from the HTML.

4. Define scoring function:
   * scoreNode: Assigns a score to an HTML node based on content and attributes.
   * Increases score for positive indicators (e.g., article, body, content tags).
   * Decreases score for negative indicators (e.g., hidden, footer, sidebar tags).
   * Adds to score based on paragraph tags and text length.

5. Find and score candidate nodes:
   * Identify potential content nodes in the cleaned HTML.
   * Score each node using the scoreNode function.

6. Select top candidate:
   * Sort candidates by score and select the highest-scoring node.

7. Extract content:
   * Use regex to extract content around the top candidate node.

8. Clean up extracted content:
   * Remove script and style tags and their contents.
   * Process anchor tags based on content density.
   * Keep only specific HTML tags (a, p, img, h1-h6, ul, ol, li).
   * Remove excess whitespace from the final content.
