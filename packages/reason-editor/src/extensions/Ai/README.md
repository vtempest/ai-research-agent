# Ai — writing assistant

Streams a model's suggestion for the current selection (or the caret), shows it
as an inline red/green diff, and writes nothing to the document until the user
accepts it.

## Entry points

| Trigger | Where |
| --- | --- |
| `AI` button | main toolbar (`RichTextAi`) |
| ✨ Ask AI | selection bubble menu |
| `⌘/Ctrl + J` | keyboard, anywhere in the editor |
| `/ai` | slash-command menu |

All four open the same floating panel (`AiMenu`): a filterable command palette
plus a free-form prompt box. Typing filters the commands; `↑`/`↓` and `Enter`
run one, `Enter` on an empty highlight submits the typed prompt instead.

## On the Plate editor

The Plate engine — `ReasonDocs`' default — has the same assistant, with the
same four entry points: ✨ Ask AI leads the selection (bubble) toolbar and the
fixed toolbar, `/ai` is in the slash menu, and `⌘/Ctrl + J` opens it anywhere.

What it shares with this extension is everything that is not ProseMirror:
`commands.ts`, `lib/prompt.ts`, `lib/sanitizeCompletion.ts`,
`lib/completionToContent.ts` and `lib/reasonEndpoint.ts`. So both engines offer
the same commands, send the same request to the same route, and clean the
response the same way. What differs is the document API and one piece of the
UX: Slate decorations can only style text that is already in the document, so
the Plate panel reviews the streamed result in place of the inline red/green
diff. Nothing is written until the user accepts, on either engine.

The Plate side lives in `src/docs-agent/plate/`: `ai-plugin.ts` (options),
`ai-controller.ts` (the state machine), `ui/ai-menu.tsx` (the panel),
`ui/ai-toolbar-button.tsx` and `kits/ai-kit.tsx` (which registers all of it).
Configure it through `ReasonPlateEditor`'s `ai` prop, or at runtime:

```ts
import { AiPlugin } from 'react-reason-editor/docs-agent';

editor.setOption(AiPlugin, 'getCompletion', createStreamingCompletion({ endpoint: '/api/ai' }));
```

## Review flow

Nothing is applied automatically. While the answer streams the panel shows it
with a **Stop** control (stopping keeps what has already arrived), and once it
settles the actions are **Replace selection** (`⌘/Ctrl + Enter`), **Insert
below**, **Try again**, **Copy** and **Discard**.

## Wiring a real model

The extension ships with an offline demo transform so the menu works with no
backend. Point it at a real one with `getCompletion`:

```ts
import { Ai, createStreamingCompletion } from 'react-reason-editor/ai';

Ai.configure({
  getCompletion: createStreamingCompletion({ endpoint: '/api/ai' }),
  // How much text around the selection is sent as context. 0 sends none.
  contextChars: 4000,
});
```

`createStreamingCompletion` handles a plain text stream, an OpenAI-compatible
SSE stream, and a single JSON object (`{ rewrittenText }`, `{ text }`,
`{ choices: [...] }`), and surfaces a JSON `error` body as the message shown in
the panel. For anything else, implement `AiCompletionFn` directly — it is
called with the instruction, the selection, a clamped context window, the
command id and a `systemPrompt`, plus an `AbortSignal` that fires when the user
cancels.

In this repo the plugin registry defaults the endpoint to the QwkSearch web
app's `/api/agent/rewrite`; it is editable (and clearable, to fall back to the
demo transform) under Settings → Plugins → AI Writing.

## What the extension guarantees about the output

- The response is sanitised before it is shown or applied: chat preambles
  ("Sure — here's a tighter version:"), code fences wrapping the whole answer,
  and quotes around the whole answer are removed, and blank-line runs are
  collapsed. The same clean-up runs on every streamed chunk, so the preview and
  the accepted text always match.
- Markdown structure in the answer (lists, headings, emphasis, tables) is
  converted to real nodes on accept, so "Key takeaways" produces a bullet list
  rather than literal `- ` characters. A single-line rewrite is inserted as
  plain text so the marks already on the range survive.
- Commands that rewrite a selection are hidden — and refuse to run — when the
  caret is collapsed, so they never answer confidently about nothing.

## Customising the commands

```ts
Ai.configure({
  commands: [
    ...DEFAULT_AI_COMMANDS,
    {
      id: 'cut-card',
      label: 'Cut this evidence',
      description: 'Condense into a debate card',
      icon: Scissors,
      group: 'transform',
      prompt:
        'Condense this evidence into a debate card. Preserve exact quotations and identify the claim and the warrant. Do not invent citations.',
    },
  ],
});
```

`group` places the command under a menu heading (`edit`, `tone`, `transform`,
`generate`), `requiresSelection: false` makes it available at a bare caret, and
`options` turns it into a submenu (that is how Translate picks its language).
