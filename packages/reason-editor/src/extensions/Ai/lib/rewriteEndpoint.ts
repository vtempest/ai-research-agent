/**
 * The `getCompletion` both editor engines default to: a POST to the host's
 * rewrite route, with the whole instruction — system rules, context window and
 * the text to act on — collapsed into one `prompt` string.
 *
 * It lives here rather than next to either engine because both need it. The
 * Tiptap `Ai` extension takes it from the plugin registry
 * (`src/editor-views/config/pluginRegistry.tsx`, where the endpoint is a user
 * setting) and the Plate editor takes it from `AiKit`
 * (`src/docs-agent/plate/kits/ai-kit.tsx`); a single definition keeps the two
 * asking the same route the same way, so a document rewritten in one engine
 * reads like a document rewritten in the other.
