- **extract-pdf** — Converts a PDF from a URL or ArrayBuffer into clean HTML with structural tagging including headings, lists, footnotes, and code blocks. Slim by default — PDF.js loads at runtime from the pdfjs-serverless CDN build — with optional OCR via IBM's granite-docling-258M model: run all pages through the frontend JS parser, all through Docling, hybrid (a regex scan flags pages with infographics/tables and OCRs only those), or point at the URL of another docling-compatible processor. Ships the Hono HTTP OCR service in its `server/` folder. Works in Node.js, Cloudflare Workers, and browser environments.

- **html-renderer-api** — A Cloudflare Worker that renders pages with Puppeteer via Browser Rendering.

The container sleeps after 5 minutes idle to conserve cost.
