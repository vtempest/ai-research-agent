 * Adapted from PredictOS by PredictionXBT (https://github.com/PredictionXBT/PredictOS),

 *
 * This package provides:
 * - AI provider clients (OpenAI, Grok/xAI, BlockRun) and prompt builders
 * - Prediction market data clients (Kalshi via DFlow, Polymarket via Dome/Gamma)
 * - The multi-agent analysis pipeline (event analysis, bookmaker, mapper)
 * - Cross-platform arbitrage detection
 * - Event/market URL fetching

// Market data clients.
// The Kalshi (DFlow) client is the canonical one exported at the top level.
// The Polymarket (Dome) client also exposes Kalshi helpers under the same
// names; to avoid ambiguity those two are re-exported here with `Dome`/`dome`
// prefixes. Import from `predictos/data/polymarket` for their original names.

// Additional API clients used by the research/execution agents.
// These are namespaced to avoid name collisions with the market-data clients
// above (e.g. `PolymarketMarket` exists in both `data/polymarket` and the
// Gamma/CLOB trading client `clients/polymarket`).
