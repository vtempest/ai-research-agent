/**
 * @fileoverview The floating player's state, as a tiny module-level store.

 * root of an app and driven from anywhere else in it (a video grid, a search
 * result, a keyboard shortcut), so the store has to be reachable without a
 * provider — and this package shouldn't force a state library on consumers.
 * `useSyncExternalStore` gives React-correct subscriptions in ~30 lines.
