# Adding a proxy to the transcript fetcher

YouTube rate-limits and bot-checks server IPs. A datacenter IP that has been
fetching transcripts for a while starts getting `LOGIN_REQUIRED` /
"Sign in to confirm you're not a bot" instead of caption tracks — which
surfaces from this package as `IpBlocked` / `RequestBlocked`. Routing the
fetcher through a proxy (ideally a rotating residential one) is the fix.

There are three ways in, depending on where the fetcher runs.

## 1. Node / Bun / Lambda: `proxyConfig`

`YouTubeTranscriptApi` takes a `proxyConfig`. Everything it fetches — the
InnerTube/watch requests *and* the caption track downloads — then goes through
the proxy.

### Any HTTP/HTTPS/SOCKS proxy

```typescript
import { YouTubeTranscriptApi, GenericProxyConfig } from 'extract-youtube';

const api = new YouTubeTranscriptApi({
  proxyConfig: new GenericProxyConfig({
    httpUrl: 'http://user:pass@proxy.example.com:8080',
    httpsUrl: 'http://user:pass@proxy.example.com:8080',
  }),
});

const transcript = await api.fetchTranscript('jNQXAC9IVRw');
```

Only one of the two URLs is required — whichever you give is used for both
schemes. Credentials go in the URL's userinfo, so URL-encode a password
containing `@` or `:`.

### Webshare rotating residential proxies

The most reliable option, and the one the config class is tuned for: buy a
**Residential** package (not "Proxy Server", not "Static Residential"), then
pass the *proxy* username and password from
[the Webshare proxy settings](https://dashboard.webshare.io/proxy/settings):

```typescript
import { YouTubeTranscriptApi, WebshareProxyConfig } from 'extract-youtube';

const api = new YouTubeTranscriptApi({
  proxyConfig: new WebshareProxyConfig({
    proxyUsername: process.env.WEBSHARE_PROXY_USERNAME!,
    proxyPassword: process.env.WEBSHARE_PROXY_PASSWORD!,
    // Optional: restrict the IP pool to given countries — lower latency, and
    // it works around location-based restrictions.
    filterIpLocations: ['us', 'de'],
    // Optional: a blocked IP is retried this many times, and each retry
    // rotates to a different IP. Defaults to 10.
    retriesWhenBlocked: 10,
  }),
});
```

`WebshareProxyConfig` appends `-rotate` to the username itself, so pass the
plain username — with or without the suffix, both work.

### From the CLI

```bash
# Generic proxy
extract-youtube jNQXAC9IVRw --proxy http://user:pass@proxy.example.com:8080

# Webshare residential
extract-youtube jNQXAC9IVRw \
  --webshare-user "$WEBSHARE_PROXY_USERNAME" \
  --webshare-pass "$WEBSHARE_PROXY_PASSWORD"
```

Nothing reads proxy settings from the environment on its own. To drive the
library from env vars, build the config yourself:

```typescript
const proxyUrl = process.env.YOUTUBE_PROXY_URL;
const api = new YouTubeTranscriptApi({
  proxyConfig: proxyUrl ? new GenericProxyConfig({ httpUrl: proxyUrl }) : undefined,
});
```

## 2. Cloudflare Workers / Vercel Edge: a custom `httpClient`

`proxyConfig` works by attaching an [`https-proxy-agent`][hpa] to each request
(see `src/http/fetch-http-client.ts`). Agents are a Node socket-level feature —
edge runtimes have no `net`/`tls` and ignore the `agent` option entirely, so on
Workers a `proxyConfig` silently fetches direct.

[hpa]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/https-proxy-agent

What works there is a *fetch-through* proxy: an HTTP endpoint that takes the
target URL and fetches it for you (Bright Data / ScrapingBee / ScraperAPI all
offer this shape, and it is ~15 lines to run your own on another Worker or a
small VPS). Inject it as the API's `httpClient` — that interface is the seam
the package fetches through:

```typescript
import { YouTubeTranscriptApi, type HttpClient } from 'extract-youtube';

/** Sends every request through a fetch-through proxy endpoint. */
class ProxiedHttpClient implements HttpClient {
  constructor(
    private endpoint: string,
    private apiKey: string,
  ) {}

  private proxied(url: string): string {
    return `${this.endpoint}?api_key=${this.apiKey}&url=${encodeURIComponent(url)}`;
  }

  get(url: string, options?: RequestInit) {
    return fetch(this.proxied(url), { ...options, method: 'GET' });
  }

  post(url: string, options?: RequestInit) {
    return fetch(this.proxied(url), { ...options, method: 'POST' });
  }
}

const api = new YouTubeTranscriptApi({
  httpClient: new ProxiedHttpClient(env.PROXY_ENDPOINT, env.PROXY_API_KEY),
});
```

Two things a proxy endpoint has to preserve for this to work: the request
method and body (the InnerTube calls are POSTs with a JSON body), and the
response body verbatim (caption payloads are JSON or XML, not HTML — a proxy
that "renders" pages will hand back the wrong thing).

## 3. Fronting it with your own cache

A proxy costs money per request, so don't spend one on a video you already
have. Cache transcripts keyed by `videoId` (plus language, if you fetch more
than one) in whatever store the app already has — a database table, KV, R2 —
and only fall through to the fetcher on a miss. Two consequences worth
planning for:

- **Cache the negative case too, briefly.** A video genuinely without captions
  will never grow them on a retry, but a bot-check failure is transient. Store
  "no captions" for hours and a rate-limit failure for minutes at most, so a
  bad afternoon doesn't get baked in.
- **Retry blocked requests, not missing ones.** `retriesWhenBlocked` on the
  proxy config only rotates IPs for requests that were *blocked*; a video with
  no caption tracks fails immediately and no proxy will change that.

## When it still fails

`IpBlocked` / `RequestBlocked` with a proxy configured means one of two
things:

- **The proxy's IP is blocked too.** Datacenter proxies get burned quickly;
  rotating residential IPs are what actually hold up.
- **The proxy was never used.** On an edge runtime `proxyConfig` is ignored
  outright (§2). Elsewhere, the fastest check is from the other side — point
  the same proxy URL at an IP-echo service with plain `curl -x` and confirm it
  answers with the proxy's IP, not the machine's.
