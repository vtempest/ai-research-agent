/**
 * A custom control, supplied by *this app* rather than the package.
 *
 * `<FloatingYouTubePlayer extraControls={...} />` renders whatever you give it
 * inside the player's control strip, and hands it the live player context, so
 * app-specific chrome doesn't have to live in the npm package. This button is
 * the demo's version of it: a half-speed toggle for following something dense.
 *
 * debate-ai.com — where this player was ported from — plugs its own
 * "slow the debate spread down" button in through exactly this prop, with its
 * own label, icon and rate. The package itself stays generic: it exposes
 * `player.setPlaybackRate()` and reports the current `playbackRate`, and the
 * host decides what the button says and what it does.
