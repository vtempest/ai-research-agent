/**
 * @fileoverview App-specific settings schema, declared as data.
 *
 * These JSON files are the single source of truth for *which* settings the app
 * exposes and how each one should be described and edited. The consuming app
 * "requests" this information at build/runtime and hands it to a renderer (see
 * the `shadcn-settings` package) that turns each declaration into a control.
 *
 * Keeping the schema here — separate from both the server config manager that
 * reads/writes the values and the components that render them — means the list
 * of settings can change without touching rendering or persistence code.
