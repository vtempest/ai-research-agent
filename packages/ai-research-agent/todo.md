## TODO

    use crx to open tab scrape

alternative to RAG which needs 100gb ram to store large doc sets

  vectorize the list of 240k popular keyphrases and store in qdrant usearch or Cloudflare. then seektopic solves the need to preindex your entire docs corpus to compare query to doc chunks to find the most relevant ones. to get results, we can expand query either by passing into LLM prompt to generate related keypphrases or search the query in the vectors db to find similar ones.. we can simply extract the Topic Phrases from the doc, get their vectors already in db, then vectorize the query and compare it to find the best phrases, then find relevant sentences across multiple docs from top results.
