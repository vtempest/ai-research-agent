almost endlessly about the legal definition of ‘war’. A State can always pretend, when it commits a hostile act against
another State, that it is not making war, but merely engaging in a police action, or acting in legitimate self-defence.
The expression ‘armed conflict’ makes such arguments less easy”, emphasis added).

conflict’. Both trigger the application of the Geneva Conventions but cover different legal realities, the latter being
more flexible and objective than the former” and it would be “premature to conclude the demise of the concept of
declared war, even if its progressive decline cannot be ignored”. See: ICRC, Commentary on the First Geneva Convention:

<p><h3>INTRODUCTION
</h3></p>

<p><h3>A. THE NOTION OF ARMED CONFLICT
</h3></p>

<p>International humanitarian law (IHL) applies to situations of armed conflict, a de facto state of hostilities
dependent on neither a declaration nor recognition of the existence of “war” by its parties. In terms of its
material scope, whether an armed conflict is an international armed conflict (IAC) or non-international armed
conflict (NIAC) will largely determine which rules of IHL apply. Articles 2 and 3 common to the Geneva Con-
ventions differentiate between the rules applicable to IACs and NIACs. However, the term “armed conflict” is
defined in neither article. Far from being an oversight, the omission plays an important role in depoliticizing
the application of the Conventions to the situations of violence for which they were conceived. Having learned
from earlier reliance on notions such as “declarations of war”, the drafters’ choice of the notion of “armed
conflict” ensured that the Conventions’ catalyst would never become a vestige of its time, but rather a concept
meant to endure and, indeed, adapt in response to the changing environments for which the Conventions are
needed.<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> The application of IHL has since been predicated on a fact-based analysis rather than only the formal
recognition by a belligerent that a state of war exists.<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>
There is no central authority under international law to classify a situation as an armed conflict; parties to a
conflict need to determine the legal framework applicable to the conduct of their military operations. For its
part, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) makes an independent determination of the facts
and systematically classifies situations for the purposes of its work. There are several reasons why the ICRC
classifies conflicts. First, the High Contracting Parties to the 1949 Geneva Conventions have entrusted the
ICRC, through the Statutes of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, “to work for the under-
standing and dissemination of knowledge of international humanitarian law applicable in armed conflicts and
to prepare any development thereof”.<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup> Second, a fundamental part of the ICRC’s mandate is to support parties
to comply with their legal obligations in situations of armed conflict.<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup> Thus, interpreting the notion of “armed
conflict” with a view to determining the applicable legal framework is also important from an operational
lens. Third, the existence of an armed conflict – whether international or non-international – is itself an
important basis for the ICRC’s mandate. For example, in IACs, the ICRC has the right to visit prisoners of war
and civilian internees. The Geneva Conventions also give the ICRC a broad right of initiative during NIACs. For
these reasons, in the event of an armed conflict, the ICRC generally informs all parties to the conflict of its legal
</p>

</p><p id="page-8"><p><h3>6 HOW IS THE TERM “ARMED CONFLICT” DEFINED IN INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW?
</h3></p>

<p>classification. The ICRC generally also informs third parties of its classification and makes the classification
known publicly. Depending on the situation, the ICRC may exceptionally choose not to inform the parties to
the conflict, third parties or the general public of its position regarding the applicable law.
In a 2008 opinion paper, the ICRC publicly presented the prevailing legal opinion on the definition of IAC and
NIAC under IHL. The opinion paper shared insights into not just how the ICRC classifies conflicts, but also how
the notion of armed conflict had been interpreted in both jurisprudence and doctrine over the nearly 60 years
since the drafting of the Geneva Conventions. In the 15 years since that publication, new challenges have arisen.
The ICRC has noted several transformations in how armed groups participate in conflicts, either as parties or
as supporters. Examples of such transformations include the support provided by coalitions of states to gov-
ernments involved in NIACs, the non-consensual use of force by states in foreign territory, the emergence of
coalitions of armed groups with fluctuating levels of organization, and the proliferation or agglomeration of
such groups.
Since 2008, the ICRC has also published new Commentaries to the First, Second and Third Geneva Conven-
tions, including Commentaries on common Articles 2 and 3,<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup> as well as reports on IHL and the challenges of
contemporary armed conflicts published in the context of the International Conferences of the Red Cross and
Red Crescent, which present several issues related to classification and identify developments in the law.<sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup>
This paper seeks to give an overview of the main features of the legal classification of contemporary armed
conflicts, and it aims to make the ICRC’s methodology for classification accessible and transparent for all
interested in the subject.

</p>

<p><h3>B. IMPLICATION OF CONFLICT CLASSIFICATION
</h3></p>

<p><h3>AND DECLASSIFICATION
</h3></p>

<p>Strictly speaking, IHL does not only apply during armed conflicts. Thus, the classification of an armed conflict
does not signal, strictu sensu, the beginning of the application of IHL. The Geneva Conventions’ very first article
requires states to “respect and to ensure respect for the [Conventions] in all circumstances”.<sup><a href="#7">7</a></sup> Furthermore,
nearly the entire gamut of treaties limiting or prohibiting the use of certain weapons, also considered part of
IHL, include obligations for states that are party to them that apply at all times regardless of the existence of a
conflict, such as the prohibitions on stockpiling anti-personnel mines, cluster munitions, biological weapons
and chemical weapons, as well as obligations related to the sale and transfer of conventional weapons.
In the aftermath of an armed conflict, parties also retain several IHL obligations. Thus, the declassification of
an armed conflict also does not signal, strictu sensu, the end of the application of IHL. For example, after the
end of an IAC, parties retain all their obligations related to the treatment of protected persons in their power,
including prisoners of war (POWs) and civilian internees, who remain protected by the respective Convention
until either their final release and repatriation (for POWs), or release, repatriation or reestablishment (for
civilian internees). In NIACs, persons protected under common Article 3, paragraph 2, continue “to benefit
from the article’s protection as long as, in consequence of the armed conflict, they are in a situation for which
common Article 3 provides protection”, or until other legal frameworks provide a more favourable protection
</p>

</p><p id="page-9"><p>to them.<sup><a href="#8">8</a></sup> In some instances, the end of hostilities signals the start of the application of certain rules of IHL.
For example, Article 6(5) of Additional Protocol II (AP II), dealing with amnesties, and some IHL obligations
relating to the clearance of certain weapons and remnants of war apply after the end of an armed conflict. Also
under AP II, persons deprived of their liberty or whose liberty is restricted after the conflict for reasons related
to that conflict benefit from key protections of the Protocol.<sup><a href="#9">9</a></sup>
The classification of an armed conflict also does not, in any circumstance whatsoever, legitimize, condone or
legalize the resort to force by any of the parties to a conflict, nor does it necessarily reprehend or prohibit that
resort to force. The legality of the resort to armed force between states is regulated by jus ad bellum, a separate
body of law drawing its rules largely from the 1945 Charter of the United Nations (UN).<sup><a href="#10">10</a></sup> Therefore, the actual
or perceived legitimacy of the resort to force as well as its lawfulness or unlawfulness under the UN Charter will
have no effect on the applicability of IHL to a specific situation. The reason for this firm distinction between
the two bodies of law is that the aims of jus ad bellum and IHL are profoundly different: the former was con-
ceived to ensure, as far as possible, international peace and security between states. The latter is designed to
protect victims of armed conflicts with no regard to who started the fighting or why fighting takes place. The
applicability of IHL can thus be contingent only on the factual criteria discussed in this paper, rather than jus
ad bellum considerations.
Similarly, a party’s motivation in resorting to force is also irrelevant for conflict classification and its related
IHL applicability.<sup><a href="#11">11</a></sup> This is important to recall in situations where one or both parties deny the existence of a
conflict because they view the opposing party as illegitimate. Legitimacy – legal, political or otherwise – is
not a relevant criterion; only the factual criteria discussed in this paper are dispositive for conflict classifica-
tion. Once classified, a conflict neither legitimizes nor delegitimizes parties to conflicts.<sup><a href="#12">12</a></sup> Correspondingly, the
application of IHL does not affect the legal status of the parties to a conflict.<sup><a href="#13">13</a></sup>

additional to the Geneva Conventions (entered into force on 7 December 1978) (AP II), Art. 2(2).
9 All persons who have been deprived of their liberty or whose liberty has been restricted for reasons related to the
conflict, as well as those deprived of their liberty or whose liberty is restricted after the conflict for the same reasons,
enjoy the protection of Art. 5 and 6 of AP II until the end of such deprivation or restriction of liberty. See: AP II, Art. 2(2).

11 In explicitly supporting the ICRC’s position, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) has
also adopted this view. See, e.g.: ICTY, Trial Chamber II, The Prosecutor v. Limaj, judgment, case No. IT-03-66-T, 30 Nov.

19 The question of whether acts by de facto organs trigger an IAC is discussed in section II(E)(ii) below (“The classification

Court for Sierra Leone, Prosecutor v. Charles Ghankay Taylor, trial judgment, case No. SCSL-03-1-T, 26 April 2012, para.
563–566.
21 As discussed in greater detail in the 2017 Commentary on the Second Geneva Convention, not every use of force
between states at sea will qualify as an IAC, for example when coast guards, suspecting a violation of their state’s
fisheries legislation, attempt to board a vessel owned or operated by another state but are met with resistance.
See: ICRC, Commentary on the Second Geneva Convention, 2017, para. 249 (Art. 2).
22 Caution should be taken, however, before dispensing of the notion of a threshold altogether. For example, it is generally
accepted among experts that cyber operations having similar physical effects to classic kinetic operations would
trigger an IAC. However, cyber operations do not always have such effects. The law is not yet settled on whether cyber
operations only disrupting or disabling the functionality of digital infrastructure trigger an IAC. A thorough discussion
on this question can be found in: ICRC, Commentary on the Third Geneva Convention, 2020, para. 286–289 (Art. 2).
</p>

<p><h3>INTERNATIONAL ARMED CONFLICTS
</h3></p>

<p><h3>A. THE BEGINNING OF AN IAC
</h3></p>

<p>Aside from a narrow exception discussed below,<sup><a href="#14">14</a></sup> IACs are only those armed conflicts in which two or more states
or other entities with international legal personality (including international organizations such as the UN or
interstate military alliances)<sup><a href="#15">15</a></sup> are opposed. Common Article 2 states that the Conventions shall apply “to all cases
of declared war or of any other armed conflict which may arise between two or more of the High Contracting Par-
ties, even if the state of war is not recognized by one of them.”<sup><a href="#16">16</a></sup> The terms “High Contracting Party” and “armed
conflict” are not further defined in the Conventions. The former refers to the states that are party to the Con-
ventions. Today, however, the Geneva Conventions are universally ratified by all states of the world; thus, “High
Contracting Party” can be used interchangeably with “state” in reference to the Geneva Conventions. Regarding
the latter term, in its seminal Tadic decision, the ICTY defined “armed conflict” in the context of an IAC as a resort
to armed force between states.<sup><a href="#17">17</a></sup> This definition has since been adopted by both national and other international
bodies and is considered customary international law. Accordingly, as stated in the ICRC’s 1952 Commentary,
“any difference arising between two States and leading to [a resort to armed force] is an armed conflict within the
meaning of [Article 2 common to the Geneva Conventions] … [i]t makes no difference how long the conflict lasts,
how much slaughter takes place, or how numerous are the participating forces.”<sup><a href="#18">18</a></sup> This is true regardless of the
organ within that state that has resorted to force. Of course, only acts attributable to a state can trigger an IAC;
acts by private persons not acting on behalf of a state do not trigger an IAC.<sup><a href="#19">19</a></sup> An IAC can, however, be triggered on
the basis of a unilateral attack, including attacks directed towards the territory, population or infrastructure of a
state. Thus, the reference to “between” in Tadic is understood broadly in terms of the existence of a belligerent
relationship between parties; indeed, even a unilateral use of force is between an attacker and a recipient of that
force, and so “between” does not only refer to reciprocal uses of force among two or more parties.
In contradistinction to the higher intensity threshold discussed below for NIACs, there is no specific level of
intensity required for IACs.<sup><a href="#20">20</a></sup> Even minor skirmishes between the armed forces – be they land, air or naval
forces<sup><a href="#21">21</a></sup> – may spark an IAC and lead to the applicability of IHL.<sup><a href="#22">22</a></sup> There are of course other acts that, while
potentially having a link to a conflict, do not meet this threshold; neither the sale nor the donation of military
</p>

</p><p id="page-12"><p><h3>10 HOW IS THE TERM “ARMED CONFLICT” DEFINED IN INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW?
</h3></p>

<p>equipment to a party to a conflict triggers an IAC. However, once a state starts using force against another,
it is both logical and in conformity with the humanitarian purpose of the Geneva Conventions that there be
no requirement of a high intensity of violence to trigger an IAC.<sup><a href="#23">23</a></sup> The force used does, however, need to be a
hostile act; that is, not the result of a mistake or of an individual acting ultra vires. Accidental “friendly fire”
between co-belligerents does not, for example, trigger an IAC between them. Therefore, when a situation
objectively shows that, for example, a state is involved as a matter of fact in military operations or any other
hostile actions against another state (by neutralizing enemy military personnel or assets, hampering its mili-
tary operations, or using or controlling its territory without its consent), the situation is an IAC.
23 The legal rationale for a “low intensity” threshold is further developed in: ICRC, Commentary on the First Geneva
Convention, 2016, para. 243–244.

</p>

<p><h3>B. IAC BETWEEN A STATE AND A NON-STATE
</h3></p>

<p><h3>PARTY: WAR OF NATIONAL LIBERATION
</h3></p>

<p>The only situation in which an IAC may be classified outside of interstate armed conflicts is a situation of
organized armed violence taking place between a party to Additional Protocol I (AP I) and a people fighting
against colonial domination, alien occupation or racist regimes in the exercise of their right to self-determi-
nation (i.e. a war of national liberation). Article 1(4) of AP I extends the definition of IAC to include such wars
of national liberation; however, IHL applicable to IACs will only apply when, in accordance with Article 96(3)
of AP I, the “authority representing a people” in this type of conflict makes a “unilateral declaration addressed
to the depositary” of AP I.<sup><a href="#24">24</a></sup>
C. THE END OF AN IAC
Just as the start of an IAC is determined on a fact-based analysis, so too is the end of an IAC. As noted above, this
requires a factual assessment in every case. Peace treaties do not always indicate the end or even the suspen-
sion of hostilities. Conversely, IACs are sometimes characterized by unstable ceasefires, a progressive decrease
in intensity, and/or intervention by peacekeepers, blurring the line between the suspension and definitive end
of hostilities, and rendering it more difficult to determine with precision when an IAC has ceased to exist from
a legal perspective.<sup><a href="#25">25</a></sup> Thus, as is the case with the classification of conflicts, the declassification of conflicts must
be based on the facts on the ground analysed in light of the applicable IHL legal criterion, which for the ICRC
is the general close of military operations. Hostilities must end with a degree of stability and permanence for
the IAC to be considered terminated. A general close of military operations means not only the end of active
hostilities, but also the end of “military movements of a bellicose nature, including those that reform, reor-
ganize or reconstitute, so that the likelihood of the resumption of hostilities can reasonably be discarded”.<sup><a href="#26">26</a></sup>
</p>

</p><p id="page-13"><p><h3>D. THE BEGINNING AND END OF AN OCCUPATION
</h3></p>

<p>27 Hague Convention IV of 1907 (HC IV of 1907), Art. 42.
28 ICRC, Commentary on the First Geneva Convention, 2016, para. 296–299 (Art. 2).
29 HC IV of 1907, Art. 42.
30 However, in certain specific and exceptional cases when foreign forces withdraw from occupied territory (or parts
thereof) while retaining key elements of authority or other important governmental functions that are typical of those
usually taken on by an occupying power and that amount to effective control for the purposes of the law of occupation,
this body of law might continue to apply within the territorial and functional limits of those competences. See: ICRC,
Commentary on the First Geneva Convention, 2016, para. 341–347 (Art. 2).
In some cases, an IAC may take the form of an occupation. Common Article 2 stipulates the application of the
Conventions to cases of partial or total occupations (regardless of whether the occupation is met with armed
resistance), though the article does not define the concept. The definition of occupation is found, however,
in Article 42 of the Hague Regulations, annexed to the Hague IV Convention of 1907.<sup><a href="#27">27</a></sup> The definition in this
provision is the standard for determining the existence of an occupation under IHL.<sup><a href="#28">28</a></sup> According to the Hague
Regulations, “[t]erritory is considered occupied when it is actually placed under the authority of the hostile
army. The occupation extends only to the territory where such authority has been established and can be exer-
cised.”<sup><a href="#29">29</a></sup> The term “authority” is not further defined in the Hague Regulations. Therefore, in order to qualify
the meaning of “authority” (and thereby identify the constitutive elements of occupation), the concept of
“effective control” must be considered. The phrase “effective control”, while long associated with the notion
of occupation, is found in neither the Geneva Conventions nor the Hague Regulations. Rather, it developed
over time in the legal discourse to describe the circumstances and conditions for determining the existence of
a state of occupation. An examination of IHL treaties and their preparatory work, scholarly literature, military
manuals and judicial decisions supports a three-part test for effective control with the following constitutive
elements of an occupation:
</p>

<p><ul>
1. the armed forces of a state are physically present in a foreign territory or parts thereof without the
    consent of the effective local government in place at the time of the invasion
</ul></p>

<p><ul>
2. the effective local government in place at the time of the invasion has been or can be rendered
    substantially or completely incapable of exerting its powers by virtue of the foreign forces’
    unconsented-to presence
</ul></p>

<p><ul>
3. the foreign forces are in a position to exercise authority over the territory concerned (or parts thereof)
    in lieu of the local government.
All together, these elements constitute the so-called “effective control test” used to determine whether a
situation qualifies as an occupation for the purposes of IHL. As this test is cumulative (that is, each of the three
elements is a necessary condition, and not an indicator, of an occupation), an occupation is considered ended
for the purposes of IHL when any one of the three conditions has ceased to exist.<sup><a href="#30">30</a></sup>
E. SELECTED ISSUES RELATED TO
    THE CLASSIFICATION OF AN IAC
I. CONSENT
As noted above, any unconsented-to use of force by one state on the territory of another state or against a state’s
sovereignty is an IAC. This includes situations where a state attacks individuals or groups within the territory
of another state without the territorial state’s consent. In some cases, a state may consent to or even call for
such an intervention on its territory, for instance to respond to a threat emanating from a group fighting the
government or operating against other states from within its borders. As long as the use of force remains
within the limits established by the territorial state and the consent is not withdrawn, these cases would not
be classified as IACs, owing to the existence of the territorial state’s consent to the use of force on its territory,
and therefore the lack of a belligerent relationship between it and the attacking state. If a state directs violence
within another state’s territory without the latter’s consent – even if the former claims that force is not used
against the government or the territorial state’s infrastructure, but rather only against another party it is

</h3></p>

<p>fighting within the framework of another armed conflict – this will still constitute an unconsented-to use of
force against the territorial state’s sovereignty and would constitute an IAC.<sup><a href="#31">31</a></sup>
II. THE CLASSIFICATION OF AN IAC BY PROXY
As discussed in Part III, below, sufficiently intense violence taking place between non-state armed groups
(NSAGs) and states is classified as a NIAC. However, when one state exercises overall control over an NSAG
fighting against another state, the conflict is classified as an IAC between the two states.<sup><a href="#32">32</a></sup> An NSAG is under
the overall control of a state when that state is “not only … equipping and financing the group, but also …
coordinating or helping in the general planning of its military activity”.<sup><a href="#33">33</a></sup> An NSAG under the overall control of
a state is subordinated to that state as its de facto organ, and members of the group become the equivalent of
agents of the state. As a result, fighting between the group and an opposing state does not give rise to a NIAC.
Rather, the situation is classified as an IAC between the state exercising overall control over the NSAG and the
state fighting that NSAG.
Similarly, a state is an occupying power when it exercises overall control over de facto local authorities or other
local organized groups that are themselves in effective control of all or part of a territory of another state. Such
an occupation by proxy would be examined using an adaptation of the effective control test for occupation by
considering whether the test’s conditions are met by agents controlled by that state or acting on its behalf.<sup><a href="#34">34</a></sup>
III. THE IDENTIFICATION OF PARTIES IN CONFLICTS INVOLVING MULTINATIONAL FORCES
International organizations, as stated above, may become party to an IAC or a NIAC. The question then arises
of who the parties to the conflict are: the individual member states that contribute their troops to that force
(troop-contributing countries, or “TCCs”), the organization itself or both the organization and some or all of
the TCCs. Answering this question requires determining to whom the sum of the multinational force’s actions
are attributable. IHL is silent on the issue of attribution. In the absence of specific criteria in IHL, one must rely
on the general rules of public international law for determining under which conditions multinational forces’
actions can be attributed to international organizations and/or the TCCs. Acts are attributable to either a state
or an international organization when that entity has control over the acts undertaken by the forces, generally
corresponding to the command-and-control structure of the forces. Therefore, in the presence of a multina-
tional force, the dispositive question to answer is which entity or entities has command and control over the
military operations. In some cases, command and control is largely transferred – albeit never fully – by the
TCC to the organization; in that case, only the latter should be considered party to the conflict. In other cases,
the TCCs retain enough command and control such that only they would individually be considered parties to
the conflict. In still other cases, the facts may indicate that both the international organization and some or all
of the TCCs may simultaneously be parties to the armed conflict, owing to the level of command and control
over the military operations maintained by both those TCCs and the organization.
31 For an elaboration on the parameters of consent in this context, as well as an examination of diverging legal opinions on
this issue, see: ICRC, Commentary on the First Geneva Convention, 2016, para. 262–263 (Art. 2).
32 This position is widely supported; the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which held that the overall control test was
not dispositive for state responsibility, found the test dispositive for conflict-classification purposes – that is, the
classification of IACs by proxy. See: ICJ, Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of
Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro), judgment, merits, ICJ GL No. 91, ICGJ 70 (ICJ 2007), 26
Feb. 2007, para. 404–406. For the ICRC’s detailed position on IACs by proxy, see: ICRC, Commentary on the First Geneva
Convention, 2016, para. 271–273 (Art. 2).

34 The adapted effective control test would thereby have the following formulation:
</p>

<p><ul>
- the armed forces of a state or agents controlled by the state are physically present in a foreign territory without
    the consent of the local government effectively in place at the time of the invasion
</ul></p>

<p><ul>
- the local government effectively in place at the time of the invasion has been or can be rendered substantially
    or completely incapable of exerting its powers by virtue of the foreign forces’ unconsented-to presence or
    by virtue of agents controlled by them
</ul></p>

<p><ul>
- the foreign forces or agents acting on their behalf are in a position to exercise authority over the territory
    concerned (or parts thereof) in lieu of the local government.

<p><h3>A. THE BEGINNING OF A NIAC
</h3></p>

<p>Without delving into the article’s historical background,<sup><a href="#35">35</a></sup> it remains important to highlight the fundamen-
tal character of Article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions, the provisions of which, while being far less
extensive than the provisions for IACs, have been recognized as a “minimum yardstick” binding in all NIACs.<sup><a href="#36">36</a></sup>
Customary IHL also applies to NIACs. In some NIACs (discussed below), AP II applies as well. With the very
narrow exception of wars of national liberation, discussed above, all armed conflicts where at least one party
is not a state (nor a supranational organization) is a NIAC.
The preparatory work to the Geneva Conventions are rich with discussions on how to restrain the article’s
application to only what could be factually described as “armed conflict”.<sup><a href="#37">37</a></sup> Several delegates<sup><a href="#38">38</a></sup> sought to
exclude the application of common Article 3 to situations of internal disturbances, banditry or other situations
of violence. In its 1995 Tadic decision, the ICTY determined that a NIAC occurs “whenever there is … protracted
armed violence between governmental authorities and organized armed groups or between such groups within
a State”.<sup><a href="#39">39</a></sup> As a result of this decision and subsequent jurisprudence, it is widely accepted today that two key
conditions must be met for a situation of violence to be considered a NIAC and therefore subject to IHL: the
non-state party/parties must be organized, and the violence between the parties must be sufficiently intense.<sup><a href="#40">40</a></sup>
The existence of a NIAC is not predicated on any other threshold or condition. In particular, as noted above,
political or other motivations of the parties play no role in the classification of a conflict.
I. ORGANIZATION
Common Article 3 and subsequent rules of IHL applicable in NIAC are a noteworthy novelty of international
law, in that they are binding on “parties” to a conflict rather than only states. The parties’ obligation to require
compliance with IHL among their members necessitates a certain degree of organization. Correspondingly,
as the ICRC has established elsewhere, a non-state party to a conflict must “possess organized armed forces.
This means for example that these forces have to be under a certain command structure and have the capacity
to sustain military operations.”<sup><a href="#41">41</a></sup> In Tadic<sup><a href="#42">42</a></sup> and subsequent jurisprudence,<sup><a href="#43">43</a></sup> the ICTY identified the threshold

<p>of organization as a requirement for the classification of a NIAC and produced a list of indicators of an armed
group’s organization. Indicators of organization include, inter alia:
</p>

<p><ul>
- the<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> existence<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> of<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> a<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> command<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> structure<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> and<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> disciplinary<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> rules
</ul></p>

<p><ul>
- the<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> existence<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> of<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> a<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> headquarters
</ul></p>

<p><ul>
- the<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> fact<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> that<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> the<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> group<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> controls<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> a<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> certain<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> territory
</ul></p>

<p><ul>
- the<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> ability<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> of<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> the<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> group<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> to<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> gain<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> access<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> to<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> weapons<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> or<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> other<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> military<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> equipment,<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> recruits
    and military training
</ul></p>

<p><ul>
- the<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> group’s<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> ability<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> to<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> establish<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> a<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> unified<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> military<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> strategy<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> and<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> use<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> military<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> tactics
</ul></p>

<p><ul>
- the<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> group’s<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> ability<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> to<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> plan,<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> coordinate<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> and<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> carry<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> out<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> military<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> operations,<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> including<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> troop<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> movements
    and logistics

<p><ul>

    or peace accords.
The identification of an armed group as sufficiently organized for the purpose of IHL classification thus does
not require the fulfilment of all indicative factors nor of any one in particular. Judicial practice does not prior-
itize any of them, yielding rather to a case-by-case analysis based on a contextual examination of the totality
of the circumstances.
II. INTENSITY
Ultimately, while the states party to the Geneva Conventions decided not to define the notion of “armed con-
flict”, the discussion on the concept’s thresholds served as an important tool to delineate the second neces-
sary condition for the beginning of a NIAC: sufficient intensity. Once potential parties to a conflict (including
NSAGs) are identified, indicators of intensity include, inter alia:
</ul></p>

<p><ul>
- the<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> number,<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> duration<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> and<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> intensity<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> of<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> individual<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> confrontations<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> between<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> them
</ul></p>

<p><ul>
- the<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> type<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> of<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> weapons<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> and<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> other<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> military<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> equipment<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> used
</ul></p>

<p><ul>
- the<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> number<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> and<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> calibre<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> of<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> munitions<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> fired
</ul></p>

<p><ul>
- the<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> number<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> of<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> persons<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> and<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> types<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> of<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> forces<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> partaking<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> in<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> the<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> fighting
</ul></p>

<p><ul>
- the<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> number<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> of<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> casualties<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> (including,<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> inter alia,<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> all<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> persons<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> killed,<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> wounded,<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> displaced<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> or<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> missing)
</ul></p>

<p><ul>
- the<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> extent<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> of<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> material<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> destruction
</ul></p>

<p><ul>
- the<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> number<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> of<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> civilians<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> fleeing<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> combat<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> zones
</ul></p>

<p><ul>
- the<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> involvement<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> of<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> the<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> UN<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> Security<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> Council,<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> which<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> may<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> also<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> be<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> a<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> reflection<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> of<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> the<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> intensity<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> of<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> a<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> conflict.<sup><a href="#44">44</a></sup>
A meaningful analysis of both intensity and organization can be challenging as, owing to the nature of armed
conflict and the fog of war, it is often difficult to collect sufficient data on several of their indicators. However,
given that the manifestation of some indicators can in turn imply the existence of others not yet empirically
confirmed, it may be possible to draw some conclusions on organization based on the findings normally only
relevant to intensity, and vice versa. For example, when information on a group’s command-and-control
structure or military equipment is unavailable, the number, duration and intensity of individual confronta-
tions between armed groups (an indicator of intensity) may suggest that one or both sides are able to mount
coordinated military operations and gain access to weapons or other military equipment, recruits and military
training (an indicator of organization). This approach invokes the permeability between certain indicators of
organization and intensity; it does not, however, replace either as a necessary condition for the classification
of a NIAC.
A NIAC begins only when the threshold of intensity between the parties is reached. As with IACs, the notion
of armed violence “between the parties” in NIACs includes unilateral uses of force. Armed violence is thus
considered part of an analysis on intensity even if it is not responded to by an opposing party, as long as the
opposing party meets the criterion of organization.
Strictly speaking, there is no minimum specific duration required for the classification of a NIAC, so hostilities
of only a brief period may still reach the intensity threshold if, in a particular case, there are other indicators to
44 Haradinaj, para. 49; see also Boskoski & Tarculovski, para. 177.
</ul></p>

</p><p id="page-17"><p>justify such an assessment.<sup><a href="#45">45</a></sup> However, as the magnitude of most indicators of intensity are also expressed over
time, the duration of hostilities cannot be overlooked and is considered to be an element in the assessment of
intensity. It is therefore extremely unlikely that a single use of force will meet the intensity threshold required
for the classification of a NIAC.
III. THE APPLICABILITY OF ADDITIONAL PROTOCOL II
AP II develops and supplements the IHL rules applicable during certain NIACs with a more robust legal
framework. While common Article 3 establishes basic humanitarian protections applicable in all NIACs, AP
II is designed to provide further protection to victims in only a subset of NIACs, as established by its material
scope of application. Article 1 of AP II states, in part, that it applies to NIACs taking place “in the territory of a
High Contracting Party between its armed forces and dissident armed forces or other organized armed groups
which, under responsible command, exercise such control over a part of its territory as to enable them to carry
out sustained and concerted military operations and to implement [the] Protocol.” From this, the following
five conditions can be obtained for the identification of a NIAC to which AP II applies:
</p>

<p><ul>
1. A NIAC under the classical conditions of organization and intensity exists.
</ul></p>

<p><ul>
2. The NIAC is taking place in the territory of a party to AP II.
</ul></p>

<p><ul>
3. The NIAC is taking place between the territorial state’s armed forces “and dissident armed forces or other
    [NSAGs]”.
</ul></p>

<p><ul>
4. The non-state party is under responsible command.
</ul></p>

<p><ul>
5. The non-state party exercises “such control over a part of its territory as to enable [it] to carry out
    sustained and concerted military operations and to implement [AP II]”.<sup><a href="#46">46</a></sup>
While the first three conditions are relatively straightforward, the fourth and fifth can be further clarified.
“Responsible command” indicates a certain organized structure within the NSAG, even if it does not have
a hierarchical military organization similar to those of regular armed forces. Such a responsible command
structure needs to be able both to impose discipline among the group members and to plan and carry out
military operations. A responsible command permits, in turn, the criteria listed in the fifth condition to
be fulfilled. Indeed, given that AP II contains several obligations that go beyond the basic humanitarian
protections of common Article 3, the additional criteria required for the Protocol’s application offer “a degree
of realism” corresponding to the “actual circumstances in which the parties may reasonably be expected to
apply the rules developed in the Protocol, since they have the minimum infrastructure required therefor”.<sup><a href="#47">47</a></sup> Of
course, the exact amount, type or stability of territorial control by the non-state party is not precisely set out
in AP II and is context-dependent. However, the territory should elude government control. The territory’s
geography, terrain, size, accessibility and population may also be relevant to assessing the level of control of
the non-state party.

<p>B. THE CLASSIFICATION OF NIACs
INVOLVING COALITIONS
48 See section 2(E)(3), above.
49 See generally: Tristan Ferraro, “The ICRC’s legal position on the notion of armed conflict involving foreign intervention
and on determining the IHL applicable to this type of conflict”, International Review of the Red Cross, No. 900, Nov. 2016,
p. 1227 (expanding further on the ICRC’s legal position on the support-based approach; note, however, that
while this article explains the ICRC’s legal position within the parameters of foreign intervention, the application of
the support-based approach is not limited to only these situations, as clarified in this opinion paper).
50 With regard to international organizations or multinational forces (such as coalitions of states), an additional criterion
requires that the action in question be undertaken pursuant to an official decision by the entity to support a party
involved in that pre-existing conflict. The support-based approach would thereby not apply to cases in which some
elements of multinational forces acted ultra vires with regard to the scope of the entity’s mandate.
Parties to conflicts increasingly tend to fight in coalitions, often in complex relationships, which makes it
necessary to identify conflict relationships and determine the applicable law. In addition to the situations
described below, it is worth restating that multinational forces, as noted above, are also sometimes party to
NIACs.<sup><a href="#48">48</a></sup> In these cases, the same analysis regarding the identification of parties, notably through an exami-
nation of the entity’s command-and-control structure, is required.
I. SUPPORT-BASED APPROACH
NIACs involving coalitions of multiple states, NSAGs or supranational organizations raise a question related to
the threshold of intensity. Traditionally, for a situation of violence to be classified as a NIAC, the intensity of the
violence between each individual state and the opposing NSAG, or between NSAGs, must reach the required inten-
sity threshold. However, when an entity – a state, an NSAG or an international organization – supports parties
to pre-existing NIACs, the supporting entity might not itself necessarily enter into such confrontations with the
adversary so as to reach the threshold of violence required to constitute a separate NIAC. Rather, the supporting
entity’s involvement might take the form of logistical support, intelligence activities for the benefit of one party
over another, or participation in the planning and coordination of military operations. These actions may effec-
tively make the supporting entity a de facto co-belligerent while illogically allowing it to avoid responsibility for
its IHL obligations and simultaneously claim protection from direct attacks. As a result, in the view of the ICRC,
the classical approach expounded in Tadic must be complemented by a support-based approach to third-party
operations in pre-existing NIACs. The decisive element here is the third party’s direct and effective contribution
to the collective conduct of hostilities by the support it provides to the state(s) involved in the pre-existing NIAC.
However, a clear distinction must be made between support that has a direct impact on the opposing party’s
ability to carry out its military operations and more indirect forms of support that would only allow the bene-
ficiary to build up its military capabilities. Only the former would turn the supporting entity into a party to the
armed conflict. Furthermore, it must be evident from the actions undertaken by the third party that it is pool-
ing or marshalling military resources or coordinating actions with one of the belligerents of the pre-existing
NIAC in order to fight a common enemy.
Using the support-based approach,<sup><a href="#49">49</a></sup> IHL applies to a state, an organized armed group or an international
organization<sup><a href="#50">50</a></sup> when:
</p>

<p><ul>
1. there is a pre-existing NIAC ongoing in the territory where an entity that is a state, an international
    organization or an organized armed group intervenes
</ul></p>

<p><ul>
2. actions related to the conduct of hostilities are undertaken by the entity in the context of that
    pre-existing conflict
</ul></p>

<p><ul>
3. the entity’s military operations are objectively carried out in support of a party to that pre-existing
    conflict, in particular by effectively pooling and mobilizing its military resources with that party.
For IHL to apply to a third party acting in support of one of the belligerents, all the above conditions must
be fulfilled.
</ul></p>

</p><p id="page-19"><p><h3>II. INCORPORATION OF AN ARMED GROUP INTO A PARTY
</h3></p>

<p>Conflicts can sometimes involve dozens of armed groups fighting each other in varying forms of alliances and
pacts, making it difficult to identify discrete parties to these conflicts.
Sometimes, armed groups, including so-called “self-defence forces”, form part of a state’s armed forces.
Armed groups that are either incorporated by law as organs of the state or are empowered by law to conduct
hostilities on the state’s behalf are incorporated into the state’s armed forces for the purposes of classification.
Armed groups that are otherwise under a command responsible to a state form part of the state’s irregular
armed forces, for the purposes of classification.
Armed groups are also considered incorporated into a party for the purposes of classification when those
groups are under the command and control of a “parent” NSAG.
III. AGGREGATING INTENSITY BETWEEN MULTIPLE ORGANIZED ARMED GROUPS,
STATE AND NON-STATE ALIKE
In other situations when there is no pre-existing NIAC, several states, organized armed groups or international
organizations may operate in a coalition where a narrow reading of Tadic would lead to legal and operational
loopholes when there is a clear coordination between these entities. Such situations arise when the level of
violence between each entity operating in a coalition and an opposing party (for example, the territorial state)
may not meet the required intensity threshold but, taken together, the level of violence between the coalition
and the opposing party does meet this threshold. In such a situation, it would be unrealistic to expect the
opposing party to respond to high-intensity violence by several entities operating as a coalition only with
law-enforcement measures. It is therefore submitted that, when multiple organized armed groups maintain
a sufficient level of coordination in a coalition, the intensity between each of them and an opposing party may
be aggregated when considering whether the threshold of intensity has been reached.<sup><a href="#51">51</a></sup>
To determine a sufficient level of coordination in a coalition, a shared ideology, similarities of political views or
the mere existence of a common enemy would not be sufficient. Rather, factual indicators must be considered,
including, inter alia, the establishment of a coordination structure,<sup><a href="#52">52</a></sup> the sharing of operational tasks, the exist-

<p>C. GEOGRAPHICAL SCOPE OF IHL DURING NIACs
53 In NIACs, IHL normally applies in the whole territory of the parties, whether or not actual combat takes place there.
54 An elaboration of these arguments may be found in the ICRC’s 2015 Challenges Report. See: ICRC, International
Humanitarian Law and the Challenges of Contemporary Armed Conflicts, ICRC, Geneva, 2015, p. 13:
https://www.icrc.org/en/document/icrc-report-ihl-and-challenges-contemporary-armed-conflicts.

Today, many NIACs around the globe do not take the form of so-called civil wars, but they are nevertheless
governed by IHL applicable to NIACs; the armed conflict test in Tadic remains broad enough to classify what
are ultimately other variants of NIACs. The territorial scope of NIACs has been the subject of some debate,<sup><a href="#53">53</a></sup>
in particular when NIACs spill over into neighbouring territory, in the case of foreign interventions, and in
relation to other situations of transnational violence:
</p>

<p><ul>
- Spillover NIAC:<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> NIACs<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> sometimes<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> spill<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> over<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> into<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> the<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> territory<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> of<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> a<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> neighbouring<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> state.<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> In<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> the<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> view<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> of<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> the
    ICRC, the applicability of IHL can therefore also spill over, but only to the part(s) of the neighbouring state’s
    territory into which the hostilities have been extended. This ensures that parties to the NIAC are not absolved
    of their IHL obligations by crossing an international border, while at the same time not overextending the
    territorial scope of IHL to the entire neighbouring country, which would not be adapted to the reality of
    that state.
</ul></p>

<p><ul>
- Extraterritorial NIAC:<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> An<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> extraterritorial<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> NIAC<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> is<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> a<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> situation<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> where<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> states<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> or<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> multinational<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> armed<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> forces
    are fighting against one or more NSAGs in another host state. In such a situation, IHL applies at least in
    the whole territory of the host state; the law is not yet settled on whether IHL would also apply in the
    territory of the sending state(s), though there are cogent legal reasons to suggest that it would apply,
    contemporaneously with international human rights law. In the territory of the sending state(s), based on
    the prevailing circumstances, the rules of international human rights law will normally be the lex specialis.<sup><a href="#54">54</a></sup>
</ul></p>

<p><ul>
- Transnational situation of violence:<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> The<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> ICRC<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> does<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> not<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> share<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> the<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> view<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> that<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> a<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> conflict<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> of<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> global<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> dimensions
    can take place between a state and an NSAG – or between NSAGs transnationally – for the simple reason
    that IHL’s ratione loci in a NIAC is necessarily limited to the territory of the state in which the NIAC is
    actually taking place (with only the very narrow exception of a spillover NIAC, defined above). Thus,
    against the backdrop of the phenomenon of so-called global terrorism, the ICRC has taken the approach
    of classifying some situations of violence as NIACs, some as IACs (when, for example, a state has not
    consented to the use of force on its territory by another state, even when that force is directed against
    an NSAG) and some as falling outside the scope of the definition of armed conflict.<sup><a href="#55">55</a></sup>
D. THE END OF A NIAC
As with the indicators of the start of a NIAC, common Article 3 does not provide formal requirements for
determining when a conflict has come to an end. Nevertheless, for both legal and operational reasons, once a
NIAC is classified, it is of course important to know when it has ended. NIACs often go through fluctuations of
intensity, and temporary dips below the intensity threshold initially used to classify a conflict are not neces-
sarily indicative of the end of a NIAC. The ICTY held in Tadic that IHL “applies from the initiation of [a NIAC]
and extends beyond the cessation of hostilities until … in the case of internal conflicts, a peaceful settlement is
achieved.”<sup><a href="#56">56</a></sup> The notion of a “peaceful settlement” is something of a misnomer, as it does not require, neces-
sarily, a peace agreement as such. The settlement, meant here in a factual and not legal sense, need not be one
accepted by or even acceptable to either or both parties. A peaceful settlement is reached when one of the two
following conditions is met, either being sufficient to qualify a NIAC as having ended:
</ul></p>

</p><p id="page-21"><p><ul>
1. One of the parties ceases to exist.
Clearly, the complete military defeat of one of the parties to the conflict, the demobilization of one or both of
the non-state parties, or the dissolution of the state party means that the armed conflict has come to an end.<sup><a href="#57">57</a></sup>
</ul></p>

<p><ul>
2. There is a lasting cessation of armed confrontations without real risk of resumption.
If both parties continue to exist, the armed conflict will also continue to exist until there is a lasting cessation
of armed confrontations without real risk of resumption, based on a factual assessment on the ground. A party
may, for instance, decide to temporarily suspend hostilities, or the pattern of violence may be such – owing to
culture, climate, diplomacy or other causes – that there are periods of cessation and resumption of armed con-
frontations. In such cases, the conflict will continue even in the face of any intervening ceasefires, armistices or
peace agreements, which, while being indicators, are not dispositive in determining the end of a NIAC. Rather,
a lasting cessation necessarily excludes any temporary lulls in fighting or oscillations in intensity. Indicators
of a lasting cessation of armed confrontation without a risk of resumption include, inter alia:

adapted to the type of conflict (international or non-international) and to the IHL treaties, including weapons
treaties, applicable to the specific situation. It is a summary of some IHL rules and is by no means exhaustive.
</p>

<p><ul>
1. PROTECTION OF PERSONS NOT OR NO LONGER
    TAKING A DIRECT PART IN HOSTILITIES
Persons not or no longer taking a direct part in hostilities such as the sick, wounded, shipwrecked, prisoners of
war and civilians must be respected and protected in all circumstances, without adverse distinction.
All sick and wounded persons must be collected and cared for, without any discrimination and in accordance
with the relevant provisions of international humanitarian law (IHL).
Upon the outbreak of the conflict, each party to the conflict must establish a National Information Bureau
(hereafter “NIB”) to account for the protected persons in its power, including prisoners of war, wounded, sick
and shipwrecked military personnel of the adverse party, and civilians deprived of their liberty. Within the
shortest possible period, each party to the conflict must give its NIB information about these protected per-
sons. The NIB must immediately forward such information to the Powers concerned, through the intermediary
of the Protecting Powers where relevant and in any case of the ICRC Central Tracing Agency, so that the next
of kin be quickly advised.
Captured combatants must be granted prisoner of war status and treated in accordance with the provisions of
the Third Geneva Convention.
Persons who take part in hostilities and are captured shall be presumed to be entitled to prisoner of war status,
if they claim such status, or if they appear entitled to such status, or if the Party on which they depend claims
such status by notification to the Party in whose hands they have fallen.
Should any doubt arise as to whether persons having committed a belligerent act are entitled to prisoner of
war status, such persons shall enjoy the protection of the Third Convention until such time as their status has
been determined by a competent tribunal.
The Third Geneva Convention and customary IHL provide, among other things, that:
</ul></p>

<p><ul>
- the<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> personal<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> details<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> of<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> persons<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> deprived<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> of<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> their<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> liberty<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> must<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> be<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> recorded.
</ul></p>

<p><ul>
- the ICRC has the right to visit prisoners of war, under Article 126 of the Third Geneva Convention, which
    must be respected. Prisoners of war must be allowed to send a capture card to their family and to the ICRC’s
    Central Tracing Agency as rapidly as possible.
</ul></p>

</p><p id="page-24"><p><h3>22 HOW IS THE TERM “ARMED CONFLICT” DEFINED IN INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW?

    from acts of violence or intimidation and from public curiosity.
</ul></p>

<p><ul>
- women shall be held in quarters separate from those of men, except where members of the same family
    are housed together, and shall be under the immediate supervision of women; they shall furthermore
    be treated with all the regard due to their sex.
</ul></p>

<p><ul>
- children<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> shall<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> be<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> held<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> in<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> quarters<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> separate<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> from<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> those<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> of<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> adults,<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> except<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> where<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> members<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> of<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> the<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> same<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> family

</ul></p>

<p><ul>
- civilians<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> deprived<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> of<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> liberty<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> for<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> whatever<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> reason<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> are<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> equally<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> entitled<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> to<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> other<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> fundamental<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> guarantees
    without discrimination. These include the prohibition of hostage-taking and the right to a fair trial.
The parties to the conflict must refrain from transferring a person in their power to another place or authority
if there are substantial grounds for believing that the person would be in danger of suffering the violation of
certain fundamental rights, in particular violence to life and person, such as murder or torture and other forms
of ill-treatment.
Children shall be the object of special respect and protection; parties to the conflict must provide them with
the care and aid they require. In particular, children affected by armed conflict are entitled to age-appropri-
ate access to education, food and health care. When deprived of their liberty, they continue to benefit from
the special protection they are entitled to as a child. The unlawful recruitment of children by armed forces
is prohibited; children must not be allowed to take part in hostilities. When necessary, persons unlawfully
recruited must be accorded all appropriate assistance for their physical and psychological recovery and their
social reintegration.
</ul></p>

</p><p id="page-25"><p><h3>2. CONDUCT OF HOSTILITIES
</h3></p>

<p>The Parties to the conflict are not entitled to an unlimited choice of means and methods of warfare and must
therefore observe a number of rules on the conduct of hostilities, in particular:
</p>

<p><ul>
- A<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> clear<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> distinction<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> must<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> be<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> drawn<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> at<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> all<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> times<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> between<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> combatants<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> and<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> civilians<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> as<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> well<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> as<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> between<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> military
    objectives and civilian objects.
</ul></p>

<p><ul>
- In case of doubt whether a person is a civilian, that person shall be considered to be a civilian.
</ul></p>

<p><ul>
- Acts or threats of violence the primary purpose of which is to spread terror among the civilian population
    are prohibited.
</ul></p>

<p><ul>
- Attacks which strike military objectives and civilians or civilian objects indiscriminately are prohibited.
</ul></p>

<p><ul>
- Attacks<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> against<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> military<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> objectives<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> which<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> may<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> be<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> expected<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> to<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> cause<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> incidental<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> loss<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> of<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> civilian<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> life,<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> injury<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> to
    civilians or damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the
    concrete and direct military advantage anticipated, are prohibited.
</ul></p>

<p><ul>
- All<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> feasible<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> precautions<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> must<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> be<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> taken<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> to<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> avoid,<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> and<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> in<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> any<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> event<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> to<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> minimize,<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> incidental<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> loss<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> of<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> civilian<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> life,
    injury to civilians and damage to civilian objects; each party to the conflict must do everything feasible to
    verify that targets are military objectives and cancel or suspend an attack if it becomes apparent that the
    target is not a military objective or that the attack may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life,
    injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation
    to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated.
</ul></p>

<p><ul>
- When<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> a<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> choice<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> is<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> possible<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> between<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> several<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> military<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> objectives<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> for<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> obtaining<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> a<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> similar<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> military<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> advantage,
    the objective to be selected must be that the attack on which may be expected to cause the least danger
    to civilian lives and to civilian objects.
</ul></p>

<p><ul>
- Each party to the conflict must give effective advance warning of attacks that may affect the civilian
    population, unless circumstances do not permit.
</ul></p>

<p><ul>
- Each party to the conflict must also take all feasible precautions to protect the civilian population
    and civilian objects under its control against the effects of attacks.
</ul></p>

<p><ul>
- The use of human shields is prohibited.
</ul></p>

<p><ul>
- Starvation<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> of<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> civilians<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> as<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> a<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> method<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> of<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> warfare<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> is<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> prohibited.<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> Objects<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> indispensable<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> to<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> the<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> survival<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> of<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> the
    civilian population, such as foodstuffs, agricultural areas for the production of foodstuffs, crops, livestock,
    drinking water installations and supplies and irrigation works, must not be attacked, destroyed, removed
    or rendered useless.
</ul></p>

<p><ul>
- Cultural<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> property<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> must<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> be<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> respected<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> and<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> protected;<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> cultural<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> objects<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> and<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> places<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> of<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> worship<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> must<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> not<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> be<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> the

</ul></p>

<p><ul>
- Works<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> or<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> installations<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> containing<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> dangerous<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> forces,<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> as<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> well<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> as<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> other<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> military<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> objectives<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> located<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> at<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> or<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> in<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> the
    vicinity of these works or installations, shall not be made the object of attack, even where these objects are
    military objectives, if such attack may cause the release of dangerous forces and consequent severe losses
    among the civilian population.
</ul></p>

<p><ul>
- Methods and means of warfare must be employed with due regard to the protection and preservation of the
    natural environment. In the conduct of military operations, all feasible precautions must be taken to avoid,
    and in any event minimize, incidental damage to the natural environment. It is prohibited to use methods or
    means of warfare that are intended, or may be expected, to cause widespread, long-term and severe damage
    to the natural environment.
</ul></p>

<p><ul>
- It is prohibited to order or to threaten that there shall be no survivors or to conduct hostilities on this basis.
</ul></p>

<p><ul>
- It is prohibited to kill, injure or capture an adversary by resort to perfidy, i.e. to commit a hostile act under
    the cover of a legal protection.
</ul></p>

<p><ul>
- Reprisals<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> against<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> civilians<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> or<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> civilian<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> objects<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> protected<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> by<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> the<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> Geneva<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> Conventions<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> are<sup><a href="#"></a></sup> prohibited.
