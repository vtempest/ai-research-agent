  "content": "imagine a particle that exceeds the cosmic speed limit and moves faster than light amazingly this idea is not just science fiction but the real result of some physical models however whether the hypothetical tach on are compatible with the theory of relativity and can be described using Quantum field theories has long been hotly disputed among experts until now because now physicists have come up with a groundbreaking new solution to the dilemma and provided new material for discussion in the expert world but how is it even possible for tacons to be ahead in the race with light what problems do they pose for researchers and how could they even help us to solve the agonizing mystery of Dark Matter some things are simply part of the basics of physics all bodies that have mass attract each other on Earth all bodies fall downwards that is towards the center of the earth and above all nothing is faster than light well that's what you might think but in fact the world of physicists also hides a hypothetical particle that we can confidently call The Cosmic Speedy Gonzalez a particle that chases through space at faster than light speeds and can even travel backwards in time at first glance we would probably only associate the breathtaking properties of the tular on with science fiction films such as Star Wars after all they are in Stark contradiction to Einstein's special theory of relativity which states that nothing can be faster than light in a vacuum the speed of light is around 300,000 km per second or 1.08 billion km hour and not even massless particles such as photons are capable of exceeding this break neck speed but sometimes a theoretical loophole is enough to give life the speed Edge in 1962 several physicists pointed out that there are several possible solutions to the equations of the special theory of relativity one of them corresponds to normal matter moving at sublight speed but another and this is the exciting part allows for particles that constantly race through space at faster than light speeds and which cannot even be slowed down to the speed of light against this background the American physicist Gerald feber introduced three terms in 1967 to categorize the particles in terms of their properties according to this tardon always move slower than light through space luxon exhibit a constant speed of light and the speed of tacons is always faster than that of light in the end however only the latter term should Prevail at this point however it should be noted that although tacons embody a mathematical solution to the equations of the special theory of real relativity this does not mean that they necessarily have to exist how to leave the light behind but how is this even possible how can a particle be faster than light well to understand this we need to take a closer look at the theoretical calculations and the resulting characteristics of tacons the experts of the 1960s discover that there could theoretically be particles whose square Mass has a negative value and which could therefore or break through Einstein's speed limit for this to succeed however they would have to be traveling exclusively at faster than light speeds this in turn is made possible by the fact that the particles lose mass and energy as the speed increases thus reversing the well-known pattern of all normal particles conversely this means that the tacons would have to be supplied with an infinite amount of energy in order to slow them down to light speed or below but how can the super luminal particles actually be created well Feinberg also presented an explanation for this at the time similar to the higs boson the tach on are also formed by the spontaneous symmetry breaking of a scalar field present in the cosmos this in turn interacts with matter and the structures are sometimes suspected of being involved in the creation of the mysterious dark energy while the existence of tacons can be explained quite simply at first glance the matter becomes all the more tricky when we look at it from a physical perspective although it is true that the superluminal particles can be described within the framework of a string theory and the Casmir effect they cannot be accommodated in the valid Quantum field theory in the same breath in this regard the experts point to three serious problems that turn tach on into a fast moving thing of impossibility the first complication is that the energy of the tach on could take on negative values under certain conditions which according to Conventional wisdom is simply impossible the next hurdle concerns the question of stability previous calculations have shown that the quantum physical tachon field would be unstable in its ground state a circumstance that would in turn trigger a kind of tsunami of super luminal particles last but not least there is the fact that the number of tachon would change depending on the state of the Observer and this is also in Stark contradiction to the current model this new model solves the tachon problems while most researchers consider the tach on to be unwanted artifacts due to their theoretical problems the team led by Jersey pus from Stockholm University saw them as a challenging task that needed to be overcome in the course of their work the experts finally came to the conclusion that the three fundamental obstacles could in fact be based on a fatal misconception but what do that mean well Poo's group has shown that the problems are based on an incorrect representation of the Lawrence group in a Hilbert space that is too small to put this in context the Lawrence group describes the symmetry of the equations that describe the laws of nature including Einstein's field equations for example the Hilbert space in turn describes the possible states of a Quantum physical scalar field in simple terms the experts attribute the tachon problems to the fact that the conditions for their physical integration have so far been squeezed into a much too narrow framework in this respect it must be taken into account that the tach on move in a different time frame as already briefly mentioned they could theoretically travel backwards in time as a result not only the initial state but also the final state of the system must be included in the tachon models the state of space must therefore be expanded and the idea that the future can have a direct influence on the present has not just been around since yesterday the bottom line however is that this phenomenon would also lead us to our understanding of the causality at absurdum after all in this case the effect would occur before the cause perhaps this is also the reason why this assumption has so far been regarded as an unconventional interpretation of some Quantum phenomena and yet the new study shows that the extension of Hilbert space makes us forget the three basic problems of the quantum physical description of the superluminal particles by doubling the Hilbert space physicists obtain a mathematically coherent framework that enables the correct quantization of the ton Fields the particles can therefore be integrated into the quantum field Theory but that's not all according to the researchers inserting the tach on could also help to solve some of the Mysteries surrounding the higs Bon and the origin of its quantum field in particular the Dynamics of the phase transition are still accompanied by huge question marks whether the latest findings of the experts from Stockholm will one day lead to these physical Secrets being revealed remains to be seen for the time being because first they have to withstand the critical voices of dissent from within their own circles kof josi from The Institute of fundamental research in Soul is of the opinion that the proposed theory is not tenable it is said to violate the locality principle of interactions in a fundamental way according to josi there are therefore most likely no particles with negative square mass at all and therefore no tach on according to josi the adjusted equations are accompanied by unphysical behavior that makes no sense whether there are particles that whip through space at faster than light speeds is therefore still controversial however their existence is now being discussed not only in the world of imaginative sci-fi authors but also in the ranks of renowned researchers who may soon shed some more light on the cosmic speed Darkness does Dark Matter consist of tachon although the existence of tacons has not been empirically proven some experts suspect that their influence in the universe could be much more significant than previously thought a new study has come to the conclusion that tachon may be at the part of the mysterious dark matter that the research world has been searching for so long it is a well-known fact that the true origins of dark matter have always been hidden its existence is postulated in the standard model of cosmology to explain the movement of visible matter and in particular the speed at which stars orbit the center of their Galaxy however as dark matter interacts neither with other matter nor with electromagnetic radiation it is not visible and can only be detected through its interaction with gravity however Dark Matter consisting of tachon would explain why the experts have not yet been able to find out what they're dealing with here the experts calculated that a cosmos filled with tachon could initially slow down its expansion and then accelerate again just as astronomers can observe in the universe it is generally assumed that dark energy is responsible for the accelerated expansion of the cosmos accordingly the idea of a tachon cosmology model could explain both dark matter and dark energy in order to compare their theoretical considerations with real data sets the researchers relied on observations of type 1A Supernova these are Supernova that always erupt with the same brightness and therefore serve as useful points for determining distance in the astronomical world and lo and behold the experts found that the tachon model can also explain the Supernova data just as plausibly as the standard model of cosmology with dark matter and dark energy so does this mean that dark matter and dark energy actually consist of tachon well not necessarily first of all researchers have to prove that tachon really exist in theory the tachon cosmology model similar to the string theory is capable of explaining many things but in practice it would also give rise to a new series of enormous problems first and foremost would be the problem of time the Casual flow of time from the past into the future on which our entire world is based would lose its validity in this form but what do we know maybe you'll press the Subscribe button right now precisely because you've already done so in the future become part of our community and never miss
