I'M GOING TO START RIGHT HERE,  EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE A LOT TO  COVER. THAT IS YOUR REACTION TO SOME OF THESE REPORTS NOT ONLY TO THIS  RULING ABOUT GOOGLE AND ITS  SEARCH BEING A MONOPOLY, BUT  SOME REPORTS THAT MOZILLA WOULD  BE THE BIGGEST LOSER.  >> IT WILL TAKE A WHILE TO SEE  THE RESULTS. MOZILLA HAS LONG BEEN A CHAMPION OF COMPETITION. EVEN TODAY, AND ALL THE DAYS,  WE'VE HAD MORE OPTIONS THAN JUST GOOGLE AND FIREFOX. WE'RE CONTINUING TO PROMOTE  CHOICE. >> OKAY. I REALIZE THIS IS A SITUATION  THAT'S GOING TO EVOLVE AND SHAKE OUT OVER THE COURSE OF LIKELY  YEARS. WE KNOW THAT GOOGLE/ALPHABET  WILL APPEAL THIS DECISION AS  WELL. HOW ARE YOU NAVIGATING THE  SITUATION? ESPECIALLY AS WE ARE SEEING THE  SEARCH LANDSCAPE EVOLVE QUICKLY  AS OpenAI AND GENERATIVE AI  CAPABILITIES BEGIN TO INFILTRATE SEARCH OPTIONS? >> I THINK THAT'S REALLY  IMPORTANT, AS WELL AS THE  BROADER CONTEXT. SO ON THE GOOGLE DEAL, WE'VE  BEEN TRYING TO MOVE TO DIVERSIFY REVENUE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. SO OUR OWN PRIVACY WITH FIREFOX  HAVE GROWN TO BE A SIGNIFICANT  ALMOST DOUBLE-DIGIT PERCENTAGE  OF OUR REVENUE. WE NOW A COMPANY THAT IS A B 2 B COMPANY, SO YOU SEE US MOVING  INTO A BUNCH OF NEW DOMAINS TO  DIVERSIFY THAT REVENUE AT THE  CORE, BUT WE'RE ALSO LEANING  INTO AI, AS YOU WOULD EXPECT. HOW WE INTERACT WITH THE  INTERNET IS CHANGING, SO THAT  INCLUDESENT FROM INTEGRATING AI  IN A BETA WAY INTO FIREFOX. JUST LIKE YOU CAN CHOOSE  DIFFERENT SEARCH MODEL, WE SET  UP A COMPANY TO REALLY GET CLOSE TO DEVELOPERS, BUILD THAT OPEN  SOURCE AND BUILD A BUSINESS FOR  OURSELVES. >> MARK, HOUSES DOES MOZILLA'S  PHILOSOPHY AND MISSION TRANSLATE TO AN AI ERA, WHERE IT'S NOT  ABOUT LINKS AND SEARCH, SO MUCH  AS UNDERSTANDING USER INTENT,  THE DEGREE TO WHICH THAT IS  STORED, WHERE IT'S STORED, AND  WHO HAS ACCESS TO THE MAP THAT  VARIOUS COMPANIES OR  ORGANIZATIONS ARE MAKING. >> I WOULD SAY THERE'S TWO WAYS, AND THEY'RE GROUNDED IN THEIR  HISTORY. WE ON WHICH TOSS ABOUT MOZILLA  DOING WELL FOR AI, AND WE  CHAMPIONED PRIVACY. THAT STILL DOES MATTER IN THE AI ERA, BUT IT'S GOING TO BE SHAPED DIFFERENTLY. CHAMPIONING PRIVACY, WE'RE  LOOKING AT LOCAL ON-DEVICE  MODELS, WE SAW IT IN AN EARLY  WAY WITH FIREFOX, IT ONLY  HAPPENS ON YOUR DEVICE. IT'S MORE PRIVATE. WE'RE ALSO DOING THINGS LIKE WE  LAUNCHED SOMETHING CALLED THAT  ALLOWS YOU TO RUN LLAMA ON YOUR  LOCAL DEVICE. AND OPEN SOURCE, WHICH HAS  ALWAYS WHAT MOZILLA HAS STOOD  TO, SOMETHING THAT DRIVES  COMPETITION, THAT WOULD BE KEY  IN AI. WE SEE THA ",
