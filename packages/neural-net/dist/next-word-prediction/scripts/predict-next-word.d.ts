 *
 * Comprehensive training function for a self-attention transformer using custom torch.js.
 * This function implements a decoder-only transformer architecture similar to GPT models,
 * training it with synthetic data using the Adam optimizer and GPU.js for acceleration.
 * In real applications, this would be:
 * - Tokenized text data (e.g., using BPE, WordPiece, or SentencePiece)
 * - Loaded from datasets like WikiText, BookCorpus, or Common Crawl
 * - Preprocessed with appropriate padding and attention masks
 *
 * Key architectural components:
 * - Token and positional embeddings
 * - Multi-head self-attention blocks
 * - Layer normalization
 * - Linear output projection
 * - Cross-entropy loss computation
 * - Adam optimization with backpropagation
 *
 *
 * Advanced usage scenarios:
 * - Fine-tuning on domain-specific data
 * - Transfer learning from pre-trained weights
 * - Ensemble methods with multiple trained models
 * - Model compression and quantization
 *
 * @example
 * ```javascript
 * import { trainNextWordPrediction, Transformer } from './transformer-training.js';
 *
 * // Train a new model
 * const results = await trainNextWordPrediction();
 * console.log('Training completed with final loss:', results.finalLoss);
 *
 * // Generate a language response based using the trained model
 * const model = results.model;
 * const predictions = model.forward(inputTokens);
 * ```
