# Debate Video Category Keyword Map

Per-category keyword assignments for a policy debate video index, derived from the
naming convention the rounds themselves use. One primary keyword per category, with
no two categories competing for the same head term.

## Title convention

Round videos are titled with a fixed four-part pattern:

```
{Year} {Tournament} - {Round} - {Team A} vs {Team B}

2025 NDT - Quarters - Kansas MR vs Wake BM
2025 NDT - Octas    - Michigan SS vs Kansas MR
2026 TOC - Finals   - GBN CR vs MBA HL
2025 TOC - Semis    - Northview CT vs MBA HM
```

That pattern splits the categories into two groups with very different keyword
situations:

- **Tournament and round categories** — the category name appears verbatim in every
  title in the category. Keywords can be mined directly from the corpus.
- **Argument and speech categories** — the category name appears in *no* title. These
  are tags applied to rounds, so their keywords come from search demand rather than
  from the corpus, and the dominant intent is instructional ("how do I run this")
  rather than archival ("show me the round").

## Category assignments

### Rounds

| Category | Videos | Primary keyword | Supporting terms |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Finals | 232 | policy debate finals | final round, championship round, `{tournament} finals {year}` |
| Semis | 160 | policy debate semifinals | semis, semifinal round, `{tournament} semis` |
| Quarters | 175 | policy debate quarterfinals | quarters, quarterfinal round, `{tournament} quarters` |
| Octas | 37 | elimination rounds / outrounds | octafinals, octas, octos, doubles, round of 16 |

### Tournaments

| Category | Videos | Primary keyword | Supporting terms |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| NDT | 305 | National Debate Tournament | NDT rounds, NDT `{year}`, college policy debate rounds |
| TOC | 156 | Tournament of Champions debate | TOC policy `{year}`, high school policy debate rounds |
| Shirley | 117 | Wake Forest Shirley | Franklin R. Shirley Classic, Shirley `{year}` |
| CEDA | 89 | CEDA Nationals | CEDA debate rounds, CEDA `{year}` |
| Harvard | 44 | Harvard debate tournament | Harvard invitational, Harvard `{year}` |

### Arguments

| Category | Videos | Primary keyword | Supporting terms |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Theory | 68 | debate theory | condo bad, conditionality, theory shell |
| Counterplan | 45 | counterplan debate | PIC, process CP, states CP, counterplan example |
| Kritik | 43 | kritik debate | K debate, cap K, security K, K aff, kritik example |
| Framework | 34 | framework debate | FW vs K aff, framework block, fairness impact |
| Topicality | 21 | topicality debate | T shell, T-USFG, extra-T |
| Disadvantage | 13 | politics disadvantage | politics DA, uniqueness link impact |

### Speeches

| Category | Videos | Primary keyword | Supporting terms |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2NR | 242 | 2NR strategy | how to give a 2NR, 2NR example, 2NR vs 2AR |
| 1AC | 217 | 1AC example | sample 1AC, how to write a 1AC, 1AC speech |

## Anti-cannibalization rules

1. **Only the Finals category targets the bare term "finals."** Tournament categories
   target `{tournament} + rounds/year` and never take `{tournament} finals` as their
   primary.
2. **Cross terms** ("NDT finals 2025", "TOC semis") carry real demand but belong to the
   intersection filter page, canonicalized toward whichever side has more inventory —
   here that is the tournament (NDT at 305 over Finals at 232).
3. **Speech categories own instructional intent; argument categories own conceptual
   intent.** 1AC and 2NR never target "kritik" and the reverse, even though most
   2NR-tagged rounds are in fact kritik rounds.
4. **Octas is in-group jargon.** Almost nobody outside the activity searches it, and 37
   videos will not sustain a standalone page. Run it as an "elimination rounds" hub
   that absorbs octas, doubles, and any round of 16.

## Thin categories

Disadvantage (13) and Topicality (21) do not have the inventory to support standalone
pages. Fold both into a combined core negative arguments page alongside Counterplan
(45) until each clears roughly 40 videos on its own.

## Verifying against the corpus

The tournament and round keywords above should be checked against the actual title
list rather than assumed. Stripping the team codes and the leading year leaves the
tournament and round tokens, which n-gram cleanly:

```bash
# titles.txt = one video title per line
sed -E 's/ vs .*//; s/^[0-9]{4} //' titles.txt \
  | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | tr -cs '[:alnum:]' '\n' \
  | grep -vE '^(the|a|vs|round|)$' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -40
```

The argument and speech categories will not appear in that output at all, which is the
expected result and the reason their keywords are demand-derived.
