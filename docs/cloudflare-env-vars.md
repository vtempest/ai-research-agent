# Cloudflare Workers environment variables

## Symptom

Variables you entered in the Cloudflare dashboard (**Workers & Pages → your
Worker → Settings → Variables**) disappear after a rebuild or deploy, and the
Worker starts failing on missing configuration.

## Cause

The rebuild runs Wrangler, and Wrangler treats its own configuration file as the
source of truth. By default `wrangler deploy` **deletes every plaintext variable
on the Worker before setting the ones found in `wrangler.toml` /
`wrangler.jsonc`** — so any variable that exists only in the dashboard is wiped.
Secrets (`wrangler secret put`) are never deleted by a deploy, with or without
the flag.
See [Wrangler commands](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/workers/)
and [Source of truth](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/#source-of-truth).

## Immediate fix

Deploy with `--keep-vars`:

```bash
npx wrangler deploy --keep-vars
```

For version uploads:

```bash
npx wrangler versions upload --keep-vars
```

## Permanent fix (what this repo does)

`keep_vars` is set in the Wrangler config, so **every** deploy path — a local
`wrangler deploy`, Workers Builds, a GitHub Actions job, or a framework wrapper
such as `opennextjs-cloudflare` / `vinext-cloudflare` — preserves dashboard
variables without anyone having to remember the flag:

```jsonc
{
  "name": "my-worker",
  "main": "src/index.ts",
  "keep_vars": true
}
```

TOML:

```toml
name = "my-worker"
main = "src/index.ts"
keep_vars = true
```

`keep_vars` is a **top-level-only** key: it applies to the Worker as a whole and
cannot be set inside a named environment (`env.production`, `env.staging`).
Wrangler ignores it there and warns about an unexpected field.

## Better long-term setup

Keep one source of truth instead of mixing dashboard variables with CLI
deployments.

Non-sensitive configuration belongs in the Wrangler config:

```jsonc
{
  "vars": {
    "API_URL": "https://api.example.com",
    "APP_ENV": "production"
  }
}
```

API keys, database credentials, and tokens belong in secrets:

```bash
npx wrangler secret put DATABASE_URL
npx wrangler secret put OPENAI_API_KEY
```

Cloudflare stores secrets encrypted and does not show their values in the
dashboard or in Wrangler, but code reads them exactly like ordinary variables
([Environment variables](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/environment-variables/)):

```js
export default {
  async fetch(request, env) {
    const apiKey = env.OPENAI_API_KEY;
    const apiUrl = env.API_URL;

    return new Response('ok');
  },
};
```

Read them off `env`, not `process.env`, unless the Worker runs with the relevant
Node.js compatibility flag.

## Wrangler environments

Variables and bindings are **not inherited** between Wrangler environments —
Cloudflare treats each one as effectively a separate Worker:

```bash
npx wrangler deploy
npx wrangler deploy --env staging
npx wrangler deploy --env production
```

Each environment needs its own `vars` block and its own secrets
([Environments](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/environments/)):

```jsonc
{
  "name": "my-worker",
  "main": "src/index.ts",
  "keep_vars": true,
  "env": {
    "production": {
      "vars": { "APP_ENV": "production", "API_URL": "https://api.example.com" }
    },
    "staging": {
      "vars": { "APP_ENV": "staging", "API_URL": "https://staging-api.example.com" }
    }
  }
}
```

```bash
npx wrangler secret put OPENAI_API_KEY --env production
npx wrangler secret put OPENAI_API_KEY --env staging
```

## Deploying from GitHub Actions

A workflow step that runs bare Wrangler has the same problem:

```yaml
- name: Deploy Worker
  run: npx wrangler deploy --keep-vars
  env:
    CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN }}
    CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID: ${{ secrets.CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID }}
```

For production, prefer defining configuration in the Wrangler config and
uploading secrets from CI rather than depending on dashboard variables:

```bash
npx wrangler deploy --secrets-file .secrets.json
```

Never commit `.secrets.json`, `.dev.vars`, or API keys.

## The four things people confuse

| | Where it lives | Survives a Wrangler deploy? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Build variables/secrets | Workers Builds settings | Only used while the framework builds |
| Worker runtime variables | `vars` in the Wrangler config | Yes — the config is the source of truth |
| Dashboard variables | Cloudflare dashboard only | **Only with `keep_vars` / `--keep-vars`** |
| Secrets | `wrangler secret put` | Yes — deploys never delete secrets |
