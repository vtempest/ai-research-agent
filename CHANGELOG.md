# MVP Phase (2026)

## September 2026 — 72 commits

- **LobeHub core engine** — the biggest bet this cycle: a Cloudflare Workers port of the lobe-chat monorepo as the future core engine for chat and settings, with QwkSearch's homepage, article extraction, and REASON docs layered on top. It landed in stages:
  - A full `packages-lobe` foundation — Hono worker, Better Auth, tRPC, D1/KV/R2/Hyperdrive bindings, plus QwkSearch's article side-panel and docs surfaces ported over — and a comprehensive test suite for it (#310).
  - All 96 upstream packages vendored verbatim into `packages-third-party`, alongside a core-engine architecture plan (#313).
  - The vendored tree removed again (#315) in favor of a phased migration plan for the chat-engine and settings cutover (#318).
  - The first phase of that plan: LobeHub's web-browsing tool can now search through QwkSearch's own engine fan-out via a new `qwksearch` search provider.
  - Two living companion docs for the plan — a per-item migration to-do list and a file-by-file reference of every QwkSearch↔LobeHub integration.
- **REASON editor sidebar**
  - Extracted into its own `react-reason-editor-sidebar` package (#305).
  - Build-order fixes so the sidebar compiles before the packages that depend on it (#306, #308, #309).
  - Restored the Tailwind `@source` scan and dock-offset padding lost in the move, and un-wiped Open Tabs from the default panel layout (#319).
  - Refined sidebar panels to stack with Open Tabs above Files, infer split view from panel count instead of a checkbox, and fixed expand/collapse-all cycling (#321).
  - Fixed sidebar-footer visibility and a duplicate font-size entry (#320).
  - Added a configurable keyboard-shortcut system to the REASON toolbar, with a central shortcut registry, live-updating tooltip shortcut chips, conflict detection, and a new Settings section for remapping bindings (#323).
- **Search & extraction**
  - Merged `extract-pdf-docling` back into `extract-pdf` with selectable processor modes (frontend/hybrid/docling) and a dependency-free OCR page-scan heuristic (#316).
  - Added a standalone React popout transcript modal to `extract-youtube`, ported from debate-ai.com (#307).
  - The article sidebar now detects Markdown-only scrape responses (e.g. from the JINA reader fallback) and renders them properly instead of showing raw `![]()` syntax, stripping navigation/cookie boilerplate along the way (#314).
- **Reliability & ops**
  - Chat failures now surface as a persistent error bubble in the conversation instead of a silent toast, backed by a new `/admin/chat-test` diagnostics page; admin access is now strictly gated to `ADMIN_EMAILS` with no first-user fallback (#322).
  - D1 reads now route through the Sessions API with per-request version bookmarking, so enabling read replication can't serve stale or out-of-order data (#324).
  - Added scoped CORS to the public, guest-usable agent routes so debate-ai.com can call them directly without an iframe (#312).
- **Other**
  - Training jobs now provision GPUs on Vast.ai's marketplace from the web dashboard instead of running in-container (#303).
  - Added a product-comparison table against Perplexity/ChatGPT/Claude/Google/Grok to the `/features` marketing page (#317), and updated its hero tagline (#311).

## August 2026 — 168 commits

- **Editor**
  - Made **Plate** the default REASON editor engine, adding the dictation and sidebar plugins it was still missing relative to the Tiptap engine (#295).
  - Layout fixes: the editable area now fills its pane without a stray border, zoom scales layout instead of applying a post-layout transform, and the Page Settings popup renders as its own portalled panel instead of clipping under a dropdown (#288).
  - Reconstructed the `packages/reason-editor/demo/` app — documented throughout the package's README but missing from the repo — from its pre-rename history (#280).
- **Search results**
  - Video results gained inline playback via a player dialog when a safe `iframe_src` is available, instead of always opening a new tab (#282).
  - A shared, tested `mapSearchResultToDocument` helper replaced duplicated pagination-mapping logic that had been silently dropping `img_src` from paginated Images results (#283).
- **Homepage widgets**
  - Gated the weather widget's rain badges to only show above 2% precipitation probability, with a more compact upcoming-days row, and gave the trending-news widget an expandable vertical view (#297).
  - Added per-topic article thumbnails to trending-news cards, plus new homepage settings to toggle and customize both the weather and trending-news widgets (#300).
- **Marketing**
  - Added a `/features` page with a hero, animated counters, an engine-name marquee, a capability bento grid, and a pipeline/client-tabs walkthrough (#289).
- **Packaging & CI**
  - Dropped `prepare`/`postinstall` lifecycle scripts from several packages (extract-pdf, extract-youtube, reason-editor, use-voice-control, qwksearch-ext) that were causing false-positive `bun install --frozen-lockfile` failures, and bumped the pinned bun version to 1.4.0 to fix the same underlying issue (#296, #298).
  - Switched package README badges from weekly to monthly npm-download counts, and added an uptime status badge to the root README (#293, #294).
- **Planning**
  - Drafted an initial LobeHub package-integration plan triaging lobe-chat's ~90 workspace packages into adopt/port/skip (#286).
  - Triaged 7 stale open PRs as already superseded by master (#287).

## July 2026 — 473 commits

  - Enhanced the `ModelSelect` component with search and category filtering.
  - Added a fallback for unmatched models in the `ModelFamiliesCarousel`, and replaced provider text labels with provider logo chips.
  - Made models click-to-select, and moved the API-key link out of the family carousel into a dedicated flow.
- **Local text-to-speech**
  - Integrated **Kokoro.js** for on-device TTS with expanded voice settings, giving article and answer read-aloud that runs locally without a cloud speech API.
- **Agent toolkit**
  - Added **Mastra** telemetry and workflow capabilities to the research agent.
  - Initialized the shared `AGENT_TOOLS` registry so tools are orchestrated through a single array.

- **Auth & sessions**
  - Added **Discord** and **LinkedIn** social login.
  - Sorted active sessions by last-updated time so the most recent conversations surface first.
- **Settings overhaul**
  - Introduced per-tab URLs with copyable anchor links, provider logo chips, and click-to-select model rows for deep-linkable, shareable configuration.
- **Search & extraction**
  - Refactored search engine and academic sources to use the native `fetch` API (dropping `grab-url`), and switched the scraper API to the `URL` constructor for parameter extraction.
  - Removed the `youtube-po-token-generator` dependency and retired the `youtube-to-text` path in favor of the leaner transcript extractor.
- **API client migration**
  - Migrated chat API calls (`useHistoryState`, `DeleteChatSessionButton`, `chatMessages`) to the published **qwksearch-api-client** (bumped to 0.9.1), consolidating backend access behind the typed client.
- **Rendering**
  - Replaced **Prism.js** with a custom `highlightCode` function and reorganized the Markdown-to-HTML conversion logic, adding broader language support along the way.
- **Reliability fixes**
  - Surfaced root-cause database errors when message saves fail.
  - Fixed a chat-history save primary-key conflict.
  - Removed a defunct free model.
  - Corrected mobile padding on the chat homepage.
- **Docs & packaging**
