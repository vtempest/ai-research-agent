<p>Anatomy of the Somatosensory System
</p>

<p><h2>FROM WIKIBOOKS<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>
</h2></p>

<p>Our somatosensory system consists of sensors in the skin
and sensors in our muscles, tendons, and joints. The re-
ceptors in the skin, the so called cutaneous receptors, tell
us about temperature (thermoreceptors), pressure and sur-
face texture (mechano receptors), and pain (nociceptors).
The receptors in muscles and joints provide information
about muscle length, muscle tension, and joint angles.

<p>Cutaneous receptors
</p>

<p>Sensory information from Meissner corpuscles and rapidly
adapting afferents leads to adjustment of grip force when
objects are lifted. These afferents respond with a brief
burst of action potentials when objects move a small dis-
tance during the early stages of lifting. In response to

man skin: Mechanoreceptors can
be free receptors or encapsulated.
Examples for free receptors are
the hair receptors at the roots of
hairs. Encapsulated receptors are
the Pacinian corpuscles and the
receptors in the glabrous (hair-
less) skin: Meissner corpuscles,
Ruffini corpuscles and Merkel’s
disks.

The spindle is a stretch receptor
with its own motor supply con-
sisting of several intrafusal mus-
cle fibres. The sensory endings of

a secondary (group II) afferent

<p>rapidly adapting afferent activity, muscle force increases
reflexively until the gripped object no longer moves. Such
a rapid response to a tactile stimulus is a clear indication
of the role played by somatosensory neurons in motor ac-
tivity.
The slowly adapting Merkel’s receptors are responsible
for form and texture perception. As would be expected for
receptors mediating form perception, Merkel’s receptors
are present at high density in the digits and around the
mouth (50/mm² of skin surface), at lower density in oth-
er glabrous surfaces, and at very low density in hairy skin.
This innervations density shrinks progressively with the
passage of time so that by the age of 50, the density in hu-
man digits is reduced to 10/mm². Unlike rapidly adapting
axons, slowly adapting fibers respond not only to the ini-
tial indentation of skin, but also to sustained indentation
up to several seconds in duration.
Activation of the rapidly adapting Pacinian corpuscles
gives a feeling of vibration, while the slowly adapting
Ruffini corpuscles respond to the lataral movement or
stretching of skin.

<p>or polymodal receptors. Polymodal receptors respond not
only to intense mechanical stimuli, but also to heat and
to noxious chemicals. These receptors respond to minute
punctures of the epithelium, with a response magnitude
that depends on the degree of tissue deformation. They al-
so respond to temperatures in the range of 40–60°C, and
change their response rates as a linear function of warm-
ing (in contrast with the saturating responses displayed by
non-noxious thermoreceptors at high temperatures).
Pain signals can be separated into individual compo-
nents, corresponding to different types of nerve fibers
used for transmitting these signals. The rapidly transmit-
ted signal, which often has high spatial resolution, is
called first pain or cutaneous pricking pain. It is well local-
ized and easily tolerated. The much slower, highly affec-
tive component is called second pain or burning pain; it is
poorly localized and poorly tolerated. The third or deep
pain, arising from viscera, musculature and joints, is also
poorly localized, can be chronic and is often associated
with referred pain.

<p>Muscle Spindles
</p>

<p>Scattered throughout virtually every striated muscle in the
body are long, thin, stretch receptors called muscle spin-
dles. They are quite simple in principle, consisting of a few
small muscle fibers with a capsule surrounding the middle
third of the fibers. These fibers are called intrafusal fibers,
in contrast to the ordinary extrafusal fibers. The ends of the
intrafusal fibers are attached to extrafusal fibers, so when-
ever the muscle is stretched, the intrafusal fibers are also

<p>stretched. The central region of each intrafusal fiber has
few myofilaments and is non-contractile, but it does have
one or more sensory endings applied to it. When the mus-
cle is stretched, the central part of the intrafusal fiber is
stretched and each sensory ending fires impulses.
Muscle spindles also receive a motor innervation. The
large motor neurons that supply extrafusal muscle fibers
are called alpha motor neurons, while the smaller ones sup-
plying the contractile portions of intrafusal fibers are
called gamma neurons. Gamma motor neurons can regu-
late the sensitivity of the muscle spindle so that this sensi-
tivity can be maintained at any given muscle length.
</p>

<p>Joint receptors
</p>

<p>The joint receptors are low-threshold mechanoreceptors
and have been divided into four groups. They signal differ-
ent characteristics of joint function (position, movements,
direction and speed of movements). The free receptors or
type 4 joint receptors are nociceptors.
