/**
 * Pick the next version npm will actually accept for a package.
 *
 * The publish workflow used to bump one patch above whichever was higher, the
 * local version or the registry's `latest` dist-tag, and assume the result was
 * free. It is not: the registry refuses a PUT for any version it has *ever*
 * seen, and plenty of those are invisible to `latest`.
 *
 *   npm error code E409
 *   npm error 409 Conflict - PUT https://registry.npmjs.org/extract-pdf
 *     - Cannot publish over previously staged version "0.1.275".
 *
 * A version reaches that state when a publish is interrupted part-way, when it
 * was published and later unpublished, or when it only ever carried a dist-tag
 * other than `latest`. Six packages hit this in one run (extract-pdf,
 * qwksearch-api-client, react-reason-editor-sidebar, search-web-api,
 * shadcn-app-dock, use-voice-control), each having "bumped" straight onto a
 * number the registry had already reserved.
 *
 * So treat the registry as the source of truth for which numbers are spent.
 * `versions` lists what is currently published; `time` additionally keeps an
 * entry for every version that ever existed, including staged and unpublished
 * ones — the exact numbers `latest` cannot see. The union of the two is the
 * taken set.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/next-free-version.mjs <package-name> <local-version>
 *   Prints the next free version, always strictly above <local-version>. If
 *   the registry says nothing about the package (a first publish, or an
 *   unreachable registry) that is just <local-version> plus a patch.
