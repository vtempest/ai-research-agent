/**
 * Root Vitest project registry.
 *
 * Replaces the old `vitest.workspace.ts`: Vitest 4 dropped support for the
 * workspace file, so that config was silently ignored and a root `vitest run`
 * fell back to globbing every test file with no per-package settings.
 *
 * Each entry points at a package's own `vitest.config.*`, which owns its
 * environment, include globs and coverage scope. Packages that use a
 * different runner are intentionally absent and run from their own scripts:
 * `domain-rank` and `extract-pdf` (bun test), `extract-youtube` (jest) and
 * `language-model-training` (pytest).

/**
 * Vitest 5's HTML reporter ignores `outputFile` and writes `<outputDir>/index.html`
 * plus its UI bundle, where `outputDir` is a *reporter option* defaulting to
 * `.vitest`. A reporter named on the command line (`--reporter=html`) is
 * constructed without options and would silently keep that default, which is how
 * `apps/test-reports/dist` came to be missing at deploy time -- so the reporter
 * and its destination both have to be declared here.
 *
 * The report stays opt-in so a plain `vitest run` does not pay for copying the UI
 * bundle; `test:report` sets this to the directory Wrangler deploys.
